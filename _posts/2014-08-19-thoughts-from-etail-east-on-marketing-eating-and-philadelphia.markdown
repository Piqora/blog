[![2014-08-12 12.19.11](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-12-12.19.11.jpg)](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-08-12-12.19.11.jpg) One of the great things about working in marketing is having the opportunity to travel to conferences and symposiums. Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at the [eTail East Conference in Philadelphia](http://etaileast.wbresearch.com/). eTail is a medium sized, focused event aimed at helping eTailers develop their skills, evaluate their process and learn about new channels and technologies. In addition to the delicious food that I'll flood the end of this post with, Philadelphia was truly a great host for the event, and I'm left with a really positive impression.

[Nick Mueller](http://twitter.com/nickmueller) and I kicked off the week with a brand new presentation on [Pinterest and Instagram: Marketing on Where Your Audience Looks](http://go.piqora.com/eTail-East_eTailEast.html?LS=Blog). It's a really fun, quick talk that really hits a couple key notes about just how much value there is for brands on these two visual networks. This turned out to be a big theme for conversation for the whole week. It seemed like every other marketer that I talked to mentioned how Pinterest was now one of their biggest traffic (and revenue!) drivers and how great a fit it was for their audience. It was great to hear about how marketers are finding success in different ways.

[Jill Renslow](http://twitter.com/jrenslow) from Mall of America gave a great presentation on how MoA is using mobile to help their customers find parking, book reservations for dinner and generally engage with the Mall in a way that creates real affinity. How cool is itÂ to go shopping, tweet about it, then run into an iPad-toting mall employee who hands you a $100 gift card? ![](http://thealisters.typepad.com/.a/6a00e551dce6248833011168413cc6970c-800wi)

I also spoke with a couple of women from [Steven Singer Jewelers](http://www.ihatestevensinger.com/), and wow, what a message. Their brand screams "I HATE STEVEN SINGER" on billboards, their website and even their business cards. It's a clever message that puts the psuedo pain that their customers feel when spending more than they might otherwise want to on necklace or gold dipped rose for the special person in their life.

These events are always a great way to pull your head out of the day to day of your daily role and learn a little bit. I find that they also humanize many of the relationships that I have with people. Too large a percentage of our interactions these days take place through a keyboard and a screen and the opportunity to meet face to face, shake hands and share a laugh is not to be discounted. Add to that the chance to sample the local cuisine and you've got what can only be qualified as a great week. If we met at eTail, let's stay in touch! You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesyee), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/wesyee), or [shoot me an email](wes@piqora.com). And if you're interested in Piqora let me know and we'll set you up with a demo.

More from the trip:

We had great seafood all week, especially this great Hot + Cold Seafood Platter at R2L:

Philly is a great city for any architecture buff:

Philly sports fans are as passionate (and angry) as they come. But they have a beautiful stadium, as shown here:

And what would a trip to Philly be without a pilgrimage to the Rocky statue?
