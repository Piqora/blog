[![Facebook Vs. Instagram](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Facebook-vs-instagram-Blog-Pic.jpg)](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Facebook-vs-instagram-Blog-Pic.jpg)

It turns out that [most marketers can’t run ads on Instagram](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adweek.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology%2Fwhy-instagram-ads-could-be-huge-facebooks-mobile-empire-159222&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNERlvBsZHPB05KVb1DIhWzksk7Bdw) isn't slowing down brand activity on the network. According to a new study released by Adweek, the gap between brand activity on Instagram and Facebook is getting narrower.

This may come as a surprise, since Facebook generates more than half of its revenue from mobile advertising ([$1.37 billion in Q4 2013](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/facebook-is-a-mobile-ad-company/).) And yet the study (which focused on U.S. based brands in Q2) reveals some incredible stats:



	
  * Brands posted to Instagram 493,000 times, a 49% jump over last year

	
  * Facebook generated 2.5 million brand posts, a growth of 22%

	
  * Brand pages on Facebook accrued 6 billion actions (likes, comments or shares), while Instagram totaled 3.4 billion actions (likes, comments)

	
  * Facebook had 2,396 actions per post, while Instagram racked up 6,932 actions per post


There are several key takeaways here. It's hardly surprising that the total number of posts and actions are higher on Facebook, given the huge gap in user base ([1.37 billion monthly active users vs. 200 million on Instagram](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/resource-how-many-people-use-the-top-social-media/).) What is amazing is that despite having fewer than 15% of the monthly active users that Facebook does, brands on Instagram got more than 56% as many total actions on their posts. In other words, **Instagram is tripling Facebook’s engagement per post.**


## What this Means for Your Instagram Strategy (or, How to Bring Your Audience FROM Facebook TO Instagram)


Consumers are shifting to Instagram and other visual social platforms in ever-increasing numbers, and marketers are following them; a 2014 survey of 249 top fashion brands found that [93% of them had Instagram accounts, up from just 63% in 2013](http://go.piqora.com/rs/pinfluencer/images/Fashion%20Marketers%20Guide%20To%20Instagram%20-%20Piqora.pdf). Harnessing this shift and encouraging your Facebook fan base to also become active on your Instagram profile should be a top priority!

Photo contests are a [great way to jumpstart audience building](http://go.piqora.com/rs/pinfluencer/images/The%20Definitive%20Guide%20to%20Instagram%20Photo%20Contests%20-%20Piqora.pdf) on Instagram. A well executed photo contest on Instagram that's promoted on Facebook, sharing the best Instagram contest photo of the day for example, is the best way to migrate latent fans over to the more engaged network.

While cross-promotion on Facebook drives awareness among your fans on that platform, it’s also important to engage with your Instagram audience directly by liking and commenting on their submissions and even following some users back. That’s the beauty of marketing on Instagram; it’s all about being a conversation leader, and engaging with your fans personally. You can individually tailor your comments on fan’s submissions, building and fostering powerful relationships with your audience.
