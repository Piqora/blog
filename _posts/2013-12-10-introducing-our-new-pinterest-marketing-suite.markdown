When we set out to redo the user experience of our Pinterest suite, our goal was to keep the things our customers love about Piqora, while making it even easier to access our powerful data. While we are changing a fair amount with this update, our hope is that the changes will make leveraging Piqora on a daily basis even more intuitive.

**Unified Metrics and Reports**




One of the main pain points we aimed to improve with the redesign was to make understanding your data easier. A big part of that was coupling high level metrics together with their associated reports. Our new unified report view fixes that. Each report now contains everything you would want to know about a particular metric aspect of your Pinterest presence. The high level metrics, graphs, and their associated reports are all time sliceable.


**More Data In One Place**

Another experience we set out to improve was how you look at data related to a specific metric or report entry. Seeing derivatives of a report item often meant leaving a report altogether, losing your place and your context. For example, if you wanted to see the results of an increase in repin per pin ratio, or what pins on a particular board increased your overall board engagement, it often required looking at two or three separate reports. We have added two new features to improve this experience.




Reports containing boards and pinner data now allow you to see more information directly inline without leaving that report. Want to see the pins that make up a particular board, or the top pins from a promotion participant? Clicking on the report entry will display a drill down to provide you valuable information about that record, all within the context of the report.




The second improvement is in how we handle second-level metrics. In our previous metrics section, we had a lot of metrics that provided valuable information about trends, but did not provide a whole lot of context on how they were affecting your overall performance. To better understand where these metrics fit, we have now moved them into their respective reports to provide a clearer picture of what they are impacting. This should provide a lot more information about your metrics, without having to lose the context of what those trends are affecting.




**Better Segmentation of Data**

Another major change in our new UI is how we segment data. Previously, we separated data by its type: Pins, Pinners, Followers, and Boards. In our new user interface, we take a more source-focused approach to segmentation. By separating data into sections focused on Website, Profile, and ROI (for our customers who have hooked in GA, Omniture, or CoreMetrics), you can gain a better picture on how well various aspects of your Pinterest presence are doing.

**Competitors Overhaul**




One of the most powerful features of the Piqora platform is garnering information about competitor's performance and strategies. We have made it even easier to see everything about a competitor - their metrics, top pins, top boards, and top users all in one place. This unified view removes the need to toggle through multiple pages to get a complete view of a brand or a competitor.


The new UI dramatically improves the way we show the competitors you are tracking, allowing you to easily sort them by any number of metrics without losing the context to how you compare with them. Clicking into an individual competitor now provides you with a time sliceable report of your competitors website and profile activity.

**Promotion Improvements**


Promotion reports have also moved over to our new unified view allowing you to see all the metrics and reports associated with your promotions in one spot. In addition, you can now more easily filter your participants by eligibility, as well as search for individual users right from within your reports.









Overall, we hope that these updates improve your experience working within Piqora, allowing you to spend more time leveraging the data to improve your presence around Pinterest.
