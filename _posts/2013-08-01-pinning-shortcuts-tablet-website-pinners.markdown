According to social sharing report from [sharethis](http://blog.sharethis.com/2013/07/22/mobile-vs-desktop-a-cross-device-user-study/) -- Pinterest is thrice as much shared on mobile than PC and 50% of all social sharing on iPad happens via Pinterest. Most of Piqora's retailer customers are seeing more than 50% of their website traffic originate from mobile devices.

Consumers are ditching desktops for mobile. Tablets are emerging as the lean-back browse oriented device that is returning shopping to its entertainment roots. Tablets are the third type of device: the one with the most revenue potential for e-commerce. Tablets drive greater volumes of traffic, that convert to paid at better rates, and drive better qualified and less expensive leads through discovery networks like Pinterest.








More impressively, overall tablet users' conversion rates are twice as strong as tablets and [20% better than PCs](http://searchengineland.com/report-tablets-offer-lower-cpc-higher-conversions-than-desktop-pcs-128548). And because the ecosystem is young, tablet ads' costs-per-click are low, generating much better ROI for advertisers, a winning combination for marketers. [Longer session times](http://blog.flurry.com/bid/90987/The-Truth-About-Cats-and-Dogs-Smartphone-vs-Tablet-Usage-Differences) during non-working hours drive this higher propensity to convert.







To top this off, [Pinterest just launched](http://blog.pinterest.com/post/56910867395/a-pinning-shortcut-for-your-iphone) an easy way for users to pin from mobile via animated pinning shortcuts. In an update to its iOS application, Pinterest has introduced a new interface design where users can press and hold on a pin in their feed, and pin easily from those pop-up contextual menus.

This new interface design makes it really easy to repin content from Pinterest's app and creates the compounding effects from repinning. More repins implies more traffic to your mobile website. More traffic that wants to buy products. More traffic that is looking to get inspired, discover and shop for products from your mobile and tablet website.
