Pinfluencer spoke at the [DMA social face off panel](http://www.vivastream.com/events/dma2012/sessions/311616) yesterday. The topic of the panel was "Should every company use Pinterest". A lot of brands are thinking about this question - Is Pinterest for me? Does Pinterest round out my social media toolset? Is it a network that creates new interaction patterns and new ways for brands to connect and foster relationships with their audience. How is Pinterest different from facebook and twitter and more importantly how should brands create specific strategies for Pinterest?

**Which types of businesses are best positioned to benefit from investing in Pinterest?**


<blockquote>If your business has online presence and your website has visual content, then the answer is you _should_ be on Pinterest. And if you are not, you are missing out Pinterest referrals and a new way to add new customers in the funnel. More specifically -- online retailers, publishers, and businesses in verticals such as fashion, soft-goods, travel, food, home decor, home furnishings, e-commerce etc. stand to benefit very directly from a strong and cultivated Pinterest presence.<!-- more --></blockquote>


**What does Pinterest bring to companies that social platforms don't?**


<blockquote>Pinterest is about social ROI -- referrals and revenue. It is an interest-graph where users follow taste-makers and where your site visitors pin organically from your website creating viral distribution of your products. Facebook is about conversation and needs to be managed very actively. As a brand if you don't post on your facebook page their is no simply no fan engagement. On Pinterest your products get pinned directly from your website, generating repins, eyeballs, clicks and finally revenue.</blockquote>


**How do you harness these benefits to drive insight?**


<blockquote>Pinterest is a environment where users are expressing aspirational and future purchase intent. Products that do well on Pinterest can be used to inform merchandising strategies, inventory selection for future seasons. Pinterest makes is easy to test content strategy via board A/B testing. It is easy to capture your brand advocates and know which products they like, which websites and brands they follow augmenting the demographic data brands have about their consumers.</blockquote>


**How should brands measure Pinterest?**


<blockquote>Pinterest is a marketers delight -- it drives clicks, pageviews, traffic that has shopping intent and revenue. These ROI metrics are actually a function of pins and pinners. Brands should be measure the rate of pinning happening from their website, how many unique pinners they are getting week over week, virality trends, clicks per pin, revenue per pin etc., compare these metrics with their competitors, and monitor the trends over time.</blockquote>


**What can brands do to improve their presence on Pinterest?**


<blockquote>The most important thing is optimizing your website for Pinterest. Your website is the source of all pinning. Make sure you have pin-it button integrated, is above the fold and is clearly visible. Make sure the product descriptions and price are auto-filled. Make your website images pinnable -- use large and high quality images.
