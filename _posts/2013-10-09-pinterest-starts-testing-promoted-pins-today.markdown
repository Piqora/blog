Pinterest has begun started testing the concept of promoted pins. The idea is to increase the visibility of the content from retailers, marketers and advertisers. This is the first ad product from Pinterest and they are doing it in a way that is tasteful, gradual and sustainable. At this point Pinterest is working with a small and private set of advertisers to test out how consumers respond to promoted pins. These advertisers are not paying Pinterest.

Promoted Pins are going to show up in search results and category feeds. User feeds are left out. However given that more than 70% of pins on Pinterest are discovered via search and browsing behavior -- this is a really smart move as users are really picky and rightfully sensitive about their self-selected and carefully crafted feeds.

Pinterest has currently turned this on for only a small subset of users.




Promoted Pins are a great win for both visual marketers as well as for consumers. Pinterest is emerging as the social e-commerce and discovery platform, and the ability to see relevant pins from advertisers when searching for a particular product or category will help both advertisers as well as consumers.




We imagine that Pinterest will carefully evolve the promoted pins product by looking at data and getting feedback from its users. And at some point will hopefully open up the promoted pins marketplace to more advertisers. We'll be watching the space closely. Feel free to reach out to us with questions at hello@piqora.com.




Pinterest also recently launched price drop alerts for retailers that have rich pins enabled on their site. That is essentially retargeting of your products and catalog done for you by Pinterest. How cool is that? With Promoted Pins and Price Alerts,Â Pinterest has the potential to emerge as a serious contestant for your direct response dollars.
