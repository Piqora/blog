It was my pleasure last week to [deliver a webinar on our new Pinterest Trends product](http://go.piqora.com/pinterest-webinar.html?LS=Blog) with our Head of Customer Success, [Tom Logan](tom@piqora.com). We received a great deal of questions, many of which we answered on the call, but others that we weren't able to get to. Below you'll find a full response to the questions that followed the presentation. Thanks again to those who attended, and if you didn't,[ it isn't too late!](http://go.piqora.com/pinterest-webinar.html?LS=Blog)


## Pinterest


**Q:** What is the male/female breakdown of users on Pinterest?
**A: **86% Women, 14% Men logging in on a monthly basis.

****Q**: **Do you have info on the average number of followers for the average american Pinterest user?
**A: **A recent study showed that the average user had 67 followers.

****Q**:** Do you know what percentage of Pinterest users utilize the app?
**A:** According to Sarah Perez of TechCrunch, Pinterest “is seeing more than 75% of its usage come through mobile applications.” Pinterest has declined to comment on this statistic, however.

****Q**:** How are companies tracking sales conversions from Pinterest? Google Analytics?
**A: **You can connect your GA or other analytics solution to Piqora to link up revenue with your Pinterest data.

****Q**: **You say that Pinterest is somewhat of an extension of a brand's product page...is that really beneficial for the brand if the traffic isn't being led back to their website?
**A: **Traffic is typically driven back to the website, which brings the obvious value, but it also functions as an online catalog for potential customers.

****Q**: **Question: Can you recommend a good ratio of brand pins on a brand board, to repins from others/influencers/etc.?
**A:** Each case is unique, but in general it’s smart to do A/B testing to determine what works best for your audience. Feel free to contact our CSM team to discuss specifics.

****Q**: **Can I use Piqora to manage multiple brands?
**A: **Absolutely! You can add separate brand domains and toggle between each brand at the top of the page. It’s a very easy process.

****Q**: **What's the rule of thumb regarding the number of boards you have - less is more or the sky's the limit?
**A: **Test, test, test! It’s a good practice to create new boards when you have new lines or categories, but the key is to pin consistently.

****Q**: **Will the new API allow us to analyze our followers demo, geo, and time on the site similar to FB Insights?
**A: **Much still remains to be seen but more data should be available as we go forward.


## Piqora


****Q**: **Can you explain the differences between Piqora and Curalate?
****Q**: **What are the general prices to have access to analytics?
****Q**: **How does your pricing work for this new platform?
****Q**: **what are the price options for your services?
****Q**: **Can you give us a live demo of the dashboard that editors and content providers would see?
****Q**: **Can you talk about differences in pricing based on which networks we'd want to use piqora for? We don't use Tumblr. If we only wanted Pinterest insights, is that available as a stand-alone? Thanks!
**A: **Please contact our sales team to discuss pricing, product comparisons and other subscription information.

****Q**: **Can you speak to the success your clients have had with rich pins vs. traditional pins?
**A: **I can’t speak directly to this, but in general I’d encourage individuals pinning on behalf of a brand to include lots of details in the description. One fun fact about rich pins that include pricing information is that individuals who’ve pinned a particular item in the past are alerted when that pinned item goes on sale. This essentially acts as a mass announcement for your sale items.

****Q**: **Does Piqora have an editorial scheduling tool?
**A: **Yes! Our Smart Scheduler automatically posts for you at the times that your audience is most engaged.

****Q**: **is there more tailored advice available for Piqora customers? Are you our marketing partner?
**A: **Absolutely! Our CSM team is dedicated specifically for this purpose. They’re available as your social media strategists and are focused on helping you maximize your investment on your social channels.

****Q**: **Does Piqora provide insights on specific "Pinfluencers" a brand should be engaging vs. just data on which posts are optimal?
**A: **Yes, there is a great deal of insight on “Pinfluencers” in the tool.

****Q**: **Did you say this product also has pinterest analytics like how many repins per pin, pins from website, etc.?
**A: **Yes! Feel free to reach out to our team directly for more info about these metrics.


## Pinterest Trends


****Q**: **How do I create a bucket?
****Q**: **How do you create these buckets?
****Q**: **How do I access buckets?
**A: **Click add bucket in the Piqora dashboard, add applicable profiles (it will map automatically) and continue to add them until you have a fully populated bucket.

****Q**: **When you create a "new" bucket, will it mine historical data, or just data available from the time it's created and forward?
**A: **The data starts being collected when you create the bucket.

****Q**: **To what extent does this integrate with Google Analytics?

**A: **The Pinterest Trends product itself is designed to enable brands to benchmark their Pinterest presences vs. a bucket designed specifically by that brand. We can’t track website traffic comparatively because we’d need to connect the actual GA ID’s in order to do this, and this is private information. Our dashboard, however, enables you to connect your brand’s GA account to closely monitor website traffic from Pinterest along with last-click attributed revenue from the site.

****Q**: **How do you see Piqora trends benefiting brands that don't have a consumer product to offer. I know you used examples such as GE and Sharpie, but do you see this also being helpful for travel and tourism brands such as destinations.
**A: **Absolutely, travel and tourism is a great fit for Pinterest as the visual aspect of travel plays extremely well on the platform.

****Q**: **Does the list of companies that I want to add to the bucket need to be a customer with Piqora?
**A: **No, you can measure any company with a Pinterest account.

****Q**: **Can this tool provide demographic information on users that have pinned?
**A: **Nope, it cannot. This is not information that Pinterest has opened up access to as of now.


## Best Practices


****Q**: **Can Bluetooth Technology companies utilize Pinterest effectively?
****Q**: **What are some of the top publishers on Pinterest?  Any similarities between the leaders in that industry?
****Q**: **Who within the food marketing space is utilizing pinterest well?
****Q**: **How can businesses that are service based utilize Pinterest for Marketing?
****Q**: **Is there a key to difference in successfully utilizing Pinterest as B2B as opposed to B2C?
**A: **When it comes to nontraditional Pinterest usage, companies can expose the people within your organization to your users, find uses for their products or services that are visually appealing or simply share interesting facts. Test!

****Q**: W**hen you talk about key influencers, do you value activity over audience size? what's the best way to know who to get behind your brand?
**A: **We value both. It’s going to be different for every brand but you can’t go wrong targeting users that are both highly active and have large audiences.

****Q**: **Do you suggest including price on the pin image of a product?
**A: **We’ve seen brands who’ve had great success with this but have also seen some users put off by it. Test it with your audience and compare the metrics!

****Q**: **Do you typically recommend adding the majority of your product catalog to pinterest, or is that considered spammy? That is, what's a good ratio to aim for in terms of how much a company adds itself vs. how much users pin from our site themselves?
**A: **Good question. I wouldn’t say it’s considered spammy at all if you’re pinning these items over a certain duration of time. Everything on your website in one day? Very spammy. Lots of product pins mixed with complimentary content that’s interesting to your demographic over time? Not spammy at all! Don’t worry about duplicate pins from users vs. a brand. There’s no downside, and we dedupe these images within Piqora’s dashboard for ease of tracking.

****Q**: **Our brand has several different businesses within it; there isn't a direct competitor to us. several of our individual units have a couple competitors, but nothing like coke vs. pepsi. any suggestions for filling a bucket?

**A: **Sure! How about brands within your extended vertical that you’d like insights on? What about top performing brands on Pinterest...what’s their approach?

****Q**: **What's the best way to get your pins to show up on searches? How do you know which words people are using for searches?
**A: **The best way to up your “searchability” is to include more details in the descriptions of your pins. I’d recommend staying away from hashtags on Pinterest as they don’t function smoothly. We don’t identify trending searches, but I’d recommend not trying to include search terms that aren’t a natural fit with your brand.
