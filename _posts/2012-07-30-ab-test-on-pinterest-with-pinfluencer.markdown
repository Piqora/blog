As a retailer you have multiple images for every product in your catalog. In the age of Pinterest, the product images that are pin worthy get a lot of pins and repins and generate traffic to your site. Prominently integrating [Pin-It button](http://pinterest.com/about/goodies/) directly on those images (appearing when the user hovers on the image) is one of the best ways to get a lot of pins. This is how Pinterest does it and that type of integration feels very native to the user, encouraging them to pin.

The other big challenge that retailers face is deciding which type of product images really inspire people and drives them to pin/like/tweet the product. Pinfluencer has tracked about 500 brands and retailers in July, 2012 and spoke to a few retailer about their needs. Here are some initial questions we got.



	
  1. **Which images do better -- product images with models or without models?**

	
  2. **Which backgrounds work well -- white or dull-gray?**

	
  3. **Which angles are best -- front angle or side angle.**




**<!-- more -->**


Luckily pinfluencer is here to help. Pinfluencer's board report computes key metrics such as Repins/Pin, Engagement-score and follower count at an _individual board level_ and helps retailers compare the performance of each board.



	
  1. Create two boards -- one as test and the other as control -- at the same time. For e.g. create one board for shoe images with model and the other without_ on the very same day_.

	
  2. _Pin on those boards at roughly the same time_. This is important -- as the repins and engagement from a board varies with the time of the day.

	
  3. Keep the _pin count same_ each day. Say if you pinned 5 images of shoes with models, pin 5 images of shoes without model

	
  4. Run this test for about 2-4 weeks, have about 50-100 images on both test and control board.

	
  5. **At the end of everyday or after the test, visit the boards tab on your Pinfluencer dashboard and compare key metrics such as Repins/Pin, engagement score etc. to evaluate which board performed better.**
