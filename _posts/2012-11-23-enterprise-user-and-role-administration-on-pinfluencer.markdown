Last month we launched Pinfluencer user administration:Â the ability to add multiple users, roles, brands and permissions from your settings page. This type of adminstration helps agencies and multi-brand customers to have separate user groups and access for each brand. At the core of this launch is the concept of the "Admin" user and separation of privileges between an admin user and a normal user. The first user to sign up for the brand or agency account is always the admin user.<!-- more -->


### Admin user privileges:





	
  1. Add other users - either as admin user or as a normal user -- and assign them to brands.

	
  2. Control which brand's dashboard normal users can have access to.

	
  3. Control which users have access to site conversion and revenue data.

	
  4. Add multiple brands and map existing or new users to it. Agencies can add multiple brand clients. Brands can add other brands that come under their corporate umbrella.

	
  5. Access all the analytics dashboards and conversion data.

	
  6. Grant access to conversion metrics such as revenue and click data from 3rd party trackers (Google Analytics, Core Metrics, Omniture).


Each brand can have multiple admin users and normal users.


### Normal user privileges:





	
  1. Access the analytics dashboard of the brand(s) that they have access to. This access is provided by the admin user.

	
  2. Access site conversion metrics for the brands(s) if the admin user granted them those permissions.




After the admin user adds the new user, the new user receives a verification email. Once the user clicks on verification link, the Pinfluencer dashboard asks to setup a login password. Afterwards, the new user can go to their own Settings page or brand dashboard.
