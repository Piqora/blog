With the potential for driving unprecedented levels of engagement, [Instagram is closing in on Facebook ](http://blog.piqora.com/instagram-marketing-brand-activity-on-instagram-is-closing-in-on-facebook/)as _the_ marketing channel for brands to build strong emotional bonds with their audiences and engage in powerful visual storytelling. But nowhere is the old "Content is King" adage more true than Instagram. While it's a well known fact that quality content is the key to success on Instagram, many brands are not taking advantage of the MASSIVE potential of another, extraordinarily powerful source of content: [their fans](http://heidicohen.com/instagram-user-generated-content-rocks-marketing-results/). Instagrammers love producing User-Generated Content that features their favorite brands, and featuring your fans' images on your brand's Instagram profile comes with the following benefits :



	
  * **AUDIENCE RETENTION: **It keeps those users you featured (and others hoping to get recognized) coming back to you for more.

	
  * **BRAND LOYALTY: **Your fans love your brand. By featuring their photos on your Instagram feed, it lets your fans know how much you love them back, fostering customer love and creating powerful brand advocates.

	
  * **INCREASED REACH: **The more users you have creating content about your brand, the more new people your content will reach organically.

	
  * **COST-EFFECTIVE, UNIQUE, AND AUTHENTIC MARKETING CONTENT: **Instagram is the perfect place to crowd source beautiful, original marketing content.


Regardless of your business model, showcasing UGC on your Instagram profile is a great move.  It has paid huge dividends for brands like Audi; by maintaining a “human” feel and highlighting UGC, they have been able to drive extraordinary levels of engagement. In fact [according to one study](http://betanews.com/2012/08/09/instagram-is-used-by-40-percent-of-big-brands-but-only-audi-uses-it-correctly/), Audi has the highest engagement level of any car brand, even outperforming brands like MTV and Starbucks, which have much larger audiences on Instagram.

Other brands have taken UGC a step further in their marketing strategy. [Z Gallerie](http://instagram.com/zgallerie) uses Instagram to showcase their products and capture the imagination and passion of their followers, and their posts regularly generate thousands of likes each. But rather than relying on expensive professional photographers, most of Z Gallerie's stunning Instagram content comes from their fans.

“The majority of the content we post is carefully curated from our customer base," said Loren Mattia, a social media specialist at Z Gallerie.  "We find that our community relates more to these because they find the styles accessible. The approachable nature of our photos and the fact that they are in-stream with photos of our customer's friends, family, and coworkers makes our customer feel more at ease and less ‘marketed to.’"

There are more than [60 million photos posted to Instagram every day](http://instagram.com/press/). At a time when many brands grapple with consistently producing quality visual content, this flood of UGC can offer a powerful, low-cost, high-quality solution.
