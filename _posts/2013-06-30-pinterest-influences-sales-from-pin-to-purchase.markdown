Accor![Piqora's top pins in Nordstorm stores](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nordstorm-300x298.jpg)ding to the latest research from SocialBarrel, Pinterest influences sales in a variety of ways -  from product discovery to consideration to actual online and offline sales. Users are getting trusted recommendations of products on Pinterest in addition to finding new ones, using Pinterest to get additional information and getting reminded to buy the products they had pinned before.

Pinterest is at the cusp of being a powerful social-commerce, product discovery channel traffic and sales as well as a strong visual social media channel enabling brands to connect with their audiences in a very visual way.



According to the survey:



	
  1. **9%** of the purchases for pinned products happens within 24 hours. This means pinning products that actually be bought by your followers and pinners is key to driving sales.

	
  2. **32%** of the purchases happened within a week indicating that Pinterest can kickstart that discovery and consideration phases of a purchase funnel.

	
  3. **59%** of the purchases happened after the first week well into 2 months indicating that Pinterest has a strong memory and reminding power, almost as organic retargeting and that content on pinterest lives long as Piqora has found from its own data research before. [http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-pins-drive-traffic-up-to-30-days-and-beyond/](http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-influences-sales-from-pin-to-purchase/)
