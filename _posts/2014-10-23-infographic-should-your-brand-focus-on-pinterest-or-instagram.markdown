Every day, brands ask us whether Pinterest or Instagram is the better marketing platform for them. We created this handy flowchart to help inform your decisions on where you should be focusing your efforts!

Choosing the most powerful visual network for your brand depends largely on **what you do** and **where you sell** your products. There are definitely cases where [one network will serve the needs of a business better than the other](http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-and-instagram-thoughts-from-the-2014-social-media-insider-summit/). For example, if you are a luxury brand, [Instagram will probably be much better for you](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/219206/for-luxury-brands-instagram-blows-pinterest-away.html) (for more info about why, check out our [Ultimate Guide to Pinterest & Instagram Marketing for Luxury Brands.](http://go.piqora.com/luxury-pinterest.html)) If you aren't a luxury brand, the answer is less cut and dry, but as a general rule brands who sell their products online and are focused on driving direct response metrics like clicks, sales and conversions should harness the power of Pinterest to promote their products, turbocharge referral traffic, increase average order value, and drive sales. On the other hand if your focus is boosting awareness and brand recall and fostering thought leadership, you should seriously consider experimenting with Instagram.

Many brands can, do, and **should **leverage both Pinterest and Instagram. They are both "happy networks," and are unique in that users follow others primarily because of similar interests, rather than personal relationships. Because they are interest based, and feature overwhelmingly positive interactions ([especially when compared to Twitter or Facebook](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234448)) that are mood-elevating, aspirational and inspirational, Instagram and Pinterest are uniquely powerful platforms for brands to connect with their fans and create meaningful and long-lasting relationships.

A final takeaway is regardless of the network (or networks) that you decide to invest in, success will come as you continually experiment with and tweak your creative to find the sweet spot that resonates with your community.
