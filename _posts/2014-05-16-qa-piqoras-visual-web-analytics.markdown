_Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr are growing faster than ever, but these visual social networks are very different that Facebook & Twitter. Marketers and brands joining these networks understandably have a lot of questions about how to grow their communities, and achieve the elusive "social ROI." The interview below was recently conducted with Piqora co-founder Sharad Verma to help answer some of the questions that marketers ask us everyday._



## How does Piqora’s analytics help my brand?



Our analytics product is designed to provide marketers with actionable insights very quickly. The high-level dashboards that our customers use for image and community insights, are built on top of this huge mountain of image data, and are designed to make finding the "gold-nuggets" of actionable data very easy. Our detailed content and community reports provide a deeper view into metrics & trends, plus contain specific recommendations.

We've also done a lot of work lately to make report generation faster than ever. Most of our custom-date monthly reports are generated under 10 seconds. For example, **Etsy is one of our customers, and they get over 3 million pins a month** and we generate a custom-date monthly report for them in under 1 minute!

## Why is Piqora's marketing suite better than others?



In short, Piqora offers the most reports and metrics across the important categories of content performance and audience composition, and we present that data in the most actionable way possible. For example, Piqora's "Competitor Dashboard" enables brands to compare their performance against their competitors, with detailed reports for each competitor’s top pins, top pinners (both influential and engaged), and top boards. Plus a detailed view of the top pins from each competitor's top boards. That’s **4 layers and 5 reports for each competitor**! 

This is important because the top pinners of your competitors' content are the perfect audience for your brand. No other visual web analytics suite provides this level of detail in their dashboard.

We've built Piqora's dashboards in this multi-layered way based on feedback from our customers, who frequently use custom dates and time-slices to understand which Pinterest boards had the most activity or engagement during a particular week or month. Not just overall top boards, but specifically which board caught the trend during a particular week. They can drill down further to see which pins had the most activity from that particular board. 

Piqora is also the only visual web analytics service that tracks participant eligibility for Pinterest contests and offers top influencer reports for each Pinterest category.

We've made Piqora’s product to help social marketers looking for deep action-oriented insights and market research teams looking to analyze consumer behavior and content trends. Our product doesn’t just look good – it's structured, cohesive and packs in a lot of meat.

## How does Piqora help me measure Social ROI?



Piqora's ROI dashboards start with the revenue trend from your Pinterest pins, show the average revenue per-pin, and the list of (de-duped) images that were responsible for that revenue. We're the only ones that offer that level of ROI analytics for Pinterest.

The philosophy behind our ROI reports is to start with a number, follow with the larger trend, and then go deep into the community members and individual pieces of content responsible for that trend. The result is umpteen insights and engagement recommendations to help marketers interact with their community at scale.



## What else does Piqora use this visual data for?



We use our visual data repository to produce detailed research studies around image ROI, social network connectivity, and the impact of hashtags on engagement. We have conducted these studies across >500 brands, correlating data from Google Analytics and the social engagement meta-data from billions of images.

We'll continue producing educational guides and original research about Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr in the future. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/piqora), or [contact us](https://www.piqora.com/#request_demo) to learn more!
