<i>Instagram Scheduler and TapShop let you Seamlessly Publish and Manage Content, Drive Revenue, and Analyze and Improve Your Results on Instagram</i>

We’re excited to announce two new products for 2015: Instagram Scheduler, which enables you to schedule in advance and publish a large volume of Instagram content, and TapShop, which allows brands to make their Instagram content shoppable, creating enhanced opportunities to drive revenue from Instagram.

Instagram Scheduler is designed to allow marketers to organize, share and publish visual content, all in one place. You can easily and seamlessly schedule posts on Instagram via a simple mobile app reminder, and all of of your Instagram content will roll up into an integrated team calendar of scheduled visual content. This means saved time and spared headaches for social media managers and their teams.

“Social Media Managers have been waiting for an easy-to-use Instagram scheduler since the platform launched in 2010,” said Piqora CEO Sharad Verma. “This product allows social teams to plan and schedule their content for the coming week all at once, and quickly publish once they get the app reminder day-of. It was designed from the ground up to save time and make their day-to-day lives easier.”

Instagram is a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3029395/bottom-line/how-the-most-successful-brands-dominate-instagram-and-you-can-too">terrific place to build communities and market products</a>, but until now there was a barrier between people seeing your products on Instagram and buying them online. We’ve overcome this obstacle with TapShop, a tool that allows brands to drive purchases directly from their Instagram profile.

“Instagram has proved to be an outstanding platform for building authentic, emotional bonds with brand audiences. With all these consumers getting inspired by the photos that brands are sharing, there’s an opportunity to enable them to discover products on Instagram and quickly shop from there,” said Piqora CTO and co-founder Naveen Akunuri.  “TapShop is our solution; Instagrammers just need to “Like” a brand’s photo and they will automatically receive an email with information on how to purchase the product.”

Here’s how it works:
<ol>
	<li>A user “Likes” one of your product posts on Instagram</li>
	<li>They are taken to a landing page that features those products, where they can purchase them immediately.</li>
</ol>
TapShop also helps your email marketing team’s efforts while driving predictable purchases, as Instagram users who “Like” a photo with TapShop enabled will be added to an email list, and will receive email notifications about the products in the photo.

In addition to the new Visual Marketing suite, Piqora’s customers will have access to Piqora’s analytics-focused dashboard, that provides marketers with data and information on Pinterest-sourced traffic and ROI, community growth and engagement on both Instagram and Pinterest, and much more. Brands and publishers can also launch Pinterest and Instagram promotions using Piqora’s dashboard.

Social platforms have become more visual than ever before. Image-focused networks like Instagram are <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/social-media-update-2014/">growing rapidly</a>, and a recent <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/nate_elliott/14-04-29-instagram_is_the_king_of_social_engagement">Forrester study</a> found that Instagram delivered brands 58 times more engagement per follower than Facebook and 120 times more engagement per follower than Twitter.

All of this is great news for brands, as almost every kind of business has images or videos associated with its products or services. To learn more about our new Visual Marketing Suite go to <a href="http://www.piqora.com">www.piqora.com</a>, and if you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with our team. We’ve gotten great customer feedback about these new tools, and we hope they help you improve how you do business on the Visual Web and exceed your marketing goals in 2015.
