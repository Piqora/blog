Pinterest [announced](http://blog.pinterest.com/post/29014286768/pinterest-open-registration) on August 8 that it was moving from its invitation-only registration practice to open signups through email, Twitter and Facebook.  In doing so, Pinterest changed not only the user acquisition dynamic, it introduced an auto-following feature.

Upon signup, new users are presented with a Pinterest style layout of images and are asked to select their favorite five images. Based on five interest areas the new user identifies, Pinterest automatically follows around 50 boards and populates the user’s feed with the images from these boards which are aligned with the user's identified interests.  In this way, new Pinterest users have their first interaction with the network peppered with products and images  -- which could be a huge boost for brands that are testing Pinterest for marketing.

The auto-follow feature is proving significant already.  When Pinterest pushes a brand’s boards to new Pinterest users, the result can be exponential increase in followers to the brand’s boards. Some brands have gotten more than 100,000 followers in the week since Pinterest changed its registration formula (Update 10/1/2012: Some brands are now in the millions of followers). Another interesting dynamic is that it's not a "follow all" whereas the brands get new followers to all their boards, it's usually only one boards and in some cases two boards that are getting the explosive follower growth. [![](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/brandb-300x131.png)](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/brandb.png)

We believe that board quality, level of activity, thematic relevance, engagement with the boards could be amongst other factors used by Pinterest's auto-follow board selection algorithm.

Here’s what this means for companies looking to market on Pinterest. First,** ****get active and stay active - pin more often**_**. **_Second, **pin visually stunning and content that is relevant to board's topic.**
