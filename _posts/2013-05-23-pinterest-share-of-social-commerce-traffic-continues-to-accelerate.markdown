Monetate published its latest E-commerce Quarterly where it studied 500 million online shopping sessions. You can download the report [here](http://pages.monetate.com/eq/?src=M-W-Web&ast=R-EQ).

The report says that that in the first quarter of 2013, 55.18% of site traffic that stemmed from social networks came from Facebook. That’s down from 62.45% in the fourth quarter of 2012. By comparison, Pinterest—which launched about three years ago—accounted for 24.96% of site traffic from social networks, up from 17.51%. The rest came from such sources as Twitter and LinkedIn.

According to Monetate Report, Pinterest also topped in the Average Order Values for shoppers coming to e-commerce sites from social networks. Monetate says those shoppers spend $80.54 per order when coming from Pinterest, compared with $71.26 for Facebook and $70.17 for Twitter.

Pinterest also has a 75% bounce rate compared to 90% for Facebook, according to BloomReach. When it comes to driving actual sales, on average, Pinterest results in $1.50 in revenue per visit, compared to $1.15 for text-based search and a mere 90 cents for Facebook.

Brands around the globe have flocked to Pinterest not only to create a presence, but to curate boards that showcase their company’s products and services. People are drawn to immersive merchandising, a trend that creates thematic categories that drive audience interaction and conversation around a brand’s content. For example, ZGallerie used Pinterest as a way to create boards around different design elements including geometric prints and colors like aquamarine and lemon that are expected to trend this coming season. With right Pinterest analytics platform, merchandising can now be optimized with product images that are popular and trending on visual platforms.
