Pinterest Promotions are a great way to drive Engagement on your Pins, Traffic to your Pinterest Page or Website, Gain Pinterest Followers, Identify Brand Influencers, and more. Here at Piqora, we’ve powered over 600 promotions, so before you plan your next campaign, consider these tips to help ensure success.




## 1. Identify Your Primary Goals & KPI’s




It’s easy to want try to achieve a lot at once - requiring a follow, pin from your Pinterest page, pin from your website, creating a board...but keeping it simple always produces the best results. What goal are you really trying to drive?




Our first tip? Figure that out. Piqora offers a menu of options that fit any goal:


**Gain Followers**







A Follow campaign is the simplest format, however with the low barrier to entry it proves to be appealing to participants. A Follow + Pin from Board option takes this one step further - and can generate even more Follows as a result of the impressions gained from shared Pin content. Piqora recommends the latter option, but only if your brand’s Pinterest page is full of fresh and appealing content!


**Drive Engagement to your Pinterest Page**







Repin from Board campaigns drive the most traffic to your brand’s Pinterest page. As more pins are being shared as a result of the campaign, more impressions are leading back to your Pinterest page.


**Drive Traffic to Your Website**

Pin from Website is the easiest option driving traffic to your Website. The key is to remember when creating a Promotion driving traffic to your Website is to keep them on your website. Asking users to Follow or Pin from Pinterest asks participants to pin and leave resulting in fewer pins.




Create-a-Board campaigns are a higher barrier to entry, but results in more board pages that Google can index driving more traffic to those board pages with your pins - and therefore more traffic to your website. With enough incentive for your participants, it can be the largest pin generating option.


**Gaining Customer Emails**





Fortunately, every Promotion type Piqora offers collects Email address for users who opt-in to receive marketing materials!


## 2. Consider Your Audience




Always create a Pinterest Promotion you would be tempted to enter. What would that require?


<!-- more -->
**A target audience that is active on Pinterest**







First ask yourself, who is your audience, and what are they pinning on Pinterest? Some of the most popular content sought after on Pinterest include DIY Tips, Recipes, Fashion, Wedding Ideas, among other categories. If you can align your brand and your Promotion with native Pinterest pinning behavior, you won’t have to convince your audience to do something they wouldn’t already do.


**Great Content to Interact With**





If you are asking users to repin from your boards or your Website, ensure that your content is up-to-date, inspirational, and comprehensive. Are you asking people to pin their dream wedding? Make sure to provide tons of options from bridesmaids dresses down to the invites. Are you a food-related brand? Try filling your boards with great recipes for the season. The more you offer your participants, the less they are likely to look somewhere else for content to pin


**An Incentive Worthy of the Barriers to Entry**







The bigger the incentive, the better the results is a good rule of thumb. We’ve seen significant uptick in participation when the incentive is valued over $1,000-5,000 versus in the hundreds.




We understand that not every brand can afford thousands of dollars worth of prizes, but there are other great options. Does your brand have great products that you can give away? Consider giving away multiple prizes to more than one winner! A brand with no product? Try offering exclusive access to content, events, memberships, and more.




The most important thing to remember is if you plan on asking your participants to do a lot in order to enter, make sure the incentive is worth it. Otherwise, stick to a simple format to achieve your goals.




## 3. Get Creative

Sticking to a simple user experience doesn’t mean you have to compromise creativity. Think of creative ways that will cater to your KPIs.


**A Creative Incentive Structure**





Petco wanted to drive Website pins and asked users to Create-a-Board. As a reward, Petco gave the winner a Gift Card worth the dollar amount they pinned. The campaign generated nearly 80,000 website pins as a result earning them one of the most successful campaigns-to-date.


**A Creative User Experience**

GILT’s Pin to Unlock* campaign plays to the site’s sense of urgency with flash sales. When the image of the Toddler’s dress has been repinned 50




times shoppers will find a link to a hidden sale on Gilt where they can purchase the dress for $28, or 77% off the full retail price. The link to the sale is only be accessible through Pinterest.




_*Please Note: Pinterest updated their Promotion Guidelines in late 2013 which doesn’t allow Brands to require Participants to repin or pin specific content. That said, “Unlock” campaigns can be carried out through # of participants OR # of pins in general as a result of the campaign._




## 4. Plan Cross Channel Promotion




A success promotion will not be discovered by itself - so don’t forget to plan your Cross Channel Promotion strategy.


Promote across all social platforms - and post multiple times throughout your campaign to keep your campaign at the top mind for users.
