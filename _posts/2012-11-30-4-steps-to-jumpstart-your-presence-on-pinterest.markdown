## **Step 2: Complete your Pinterest Profile**


****Create 10 boards so that your profile looks complete and well attended to and pin at least 10 pins on to each board. This will make sure that your boards also look complete and spiffy. Make sure to use a combination of pins that not only express your brand identity but are also about products/media/content from your website.

## **Step3: Turn your engaged pinners into Followers**


****Your site visitors are already pinning content from your website. Take advantage of that. Use Pinfluencer's dashboard to identify which site visitors are already active pinners and use Pinner360 to like and comment on their Pins. Those reciprocal social actions will turn your brand advocate pinners into even more loyal followers.
