A lot of has been said about influence and influencer analytics recently. [Klout and Kred have revamped their UI](http://allthingsd.com/20120822/with-new-kred-and-klout-revamps-its-makeover-season-for-social-influence/) and have added 300-400 new signals to compute an individual's influence score. What has not changed is the focus on one single score.

What is wrong with the science fest of mixing myriad signals and distilling those into one score? Everything. Jay Baer from convinceandconvert.com [talks very thoughtfully about the meaning of influence](http://www.convinceandconvert.com/influencer-outreach/the-fight-for-the-future-of-influencer-analytics/). He says:


<blockquote>Influence is about causing action and behavior amongst people to whom the individual is connected. The propensity for actions and behaviors not only varies significantly from topic to topic but is also network dependent. Due to evolutionary reasons of a network's history or otherwise, people interact, behave and tune-in into different networks differently. For those reasons a topic and network specific scheme is a much more targeted approach for tracking influence.<!-- more --></blockquote>


We agree. It is not about reach, it is not about audience, it is not about how many followers one has. Influence varies with topic, it varies with network. Influence is about causing action. period. This is why while I read and retweet [Mark Suster's blogs](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/) (a VC I greatly admire), I care less about his taste for cowboy hats or lack thereof.

Pinner influence analytics on Pinfluencer is about action and behavior. **Our influence score predicts the probability of action and virality from the followers of the user. Same user has a different score for different brands. Pinfluencer's influence score is very very brand specific.**

Amongst all social media actions currently available -- clicks, re-tweet, re-share, favorite, like, repin -- we believe that "repins" are dispropportionaly powerful. _Because repinning is for yourself._ Repin indicates that your followers thought of your pin worthy enough to be permanently added to their profile. Its an act of _ownership_. Ownership is much more powerful than curiosity clicks or pandering retweets. The bar is much higher. The influence algorithms at pinfluencer go straight at this powerful metric and predict users repin potential.

Pinterest is about things and products fundamentally, people and conversation secondarily. When a user decides to click on an image from a sea of visuals it's more about the emotional and visual appeal of the pin and less about the person who originally posted that pin. _**The whole point of pinterest is - self selection into interests -- and then surgical pursuit of "boards" (not people) that cater to those interests. Pinterest disintermediates people -- and takes users straight to their interests.**_

Influence on Pinterest works in a very different way. A user's pin can get a lot of repins (causing action and behavior) not because that user has any type of "clout" per se; it is because that user tends to post high quality pins in highly coherent interest groups (his/her followers)._ Pinterest democratizes influence_. Taste, Quality and whether your followers like your interests are drivers of action and behavior. _It's less about "you", it's more about whether I like your taste_.

The influencer score at Pinfluencer -- is very specific to a brand (for e.g. Gap). It is not one universal score fit all. It predicts the viral potential of a user's pinterest action on that_ brand's content_. That is why its so powerful.
