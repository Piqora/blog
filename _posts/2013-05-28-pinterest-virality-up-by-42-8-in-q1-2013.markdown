We recently tracked the Pinterest Virality of 200 brands who have connected their Google Analytics, Omniture or Coremetrics with their Piqora account. Piqora measures Pinterest virality as Repin/Pin ratio for the Pins that originate from the website and profile boards of these brands.

**Average Repin/Pin ratio in Q4, 2012 was 0.21**

**Average Repin/Pin ratio in Q1, 2013 was 0.3**

That's a 42.8% jump in virality and it shows that as Pinterest user base grows (some estimates say that there are now ~70 million users on Pinterest), the engagement continues to trend upward. This phenomenon is rare in the growth of any online network. Generally engagement declines with the audience size.

What this means for you as a marketer is to pay a lot of attention of this hyper-engaged visually driven community of users on Pinterest. Engagement on Pinterest is Intent. Repinning a product is an act of acquiring the product virtually and represents latent shopping intent. Engagement on Pinterest is also Reach. Higher network virality leads to much higher amplification of your content and brand message on Pinterest.
