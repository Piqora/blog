Like with other social networks, there are a lot of do's and don'ts when it comes to Pinterest promotions. Social network guidelines can seem to be in a perpetual state of change - no surprise given that the platforms themselves are constantly evolving. From a marketer's standpoint, these changes can be a mixed bag and are sometimes befuddling.

To try to make sense of them, remember that it almost always comes down to optimizing User Experience, one way or another. Pinterest in particular has made it very clear that their users will always come first, and in the case of contests, they understandably want to minimize spam.

To avoid snafus and make sure your promotions are as successful as possible, it's a good idea to stay abreast of changes. The biggest change that is likely to impact pretty much anyone running a promotion is that brands can no longer require users to pin from a specific board or website. At first this seems like it could spell big trouble for marketers, but don't worry, there's an easy workaround: Suggest a place to start pinning that will provide the user with "inspiration", rather than making it mandatory to pin from that location. For example, "Pin your holiday wish list with inspiration from our Stocking Stuffer Board." Here's an example of how MacKenzie-Childs worked around the issue.

You can't exclude users who pin from different locations, but you can provide a link to the inspiration location and the vast majority of users will go there. This includes directing participants to wherever you'd like after the form is filled out, such as a board or a website.  You can still require a profile follow, and for the user to create a board, however the latter is a high barrier to entry and may reduce participation. <!-- more -->

Finally, with it's latest changes, Pinterest also announced that their guidelines are now being considered strict rules. Although they have not stated officially what will happen if the rules are broken, in the past they have removed pins from contests they don't approve of.

You can read Pinterest's post on the latest changes on their [business blog](http://businessblog.pinterest.com/post/64976400223/better-ways-to-reach-pinners), and in case you need a refresher on all the do's and don'ts of Pinterest promotions, here's the complete list, taken from Pinterest's webpage on brand guidelines.


#### Do:





	
  * Remember that Pinterest is all about people discovering things that inspire them. Reward quality over quantity.

	
  * Make it easy to get involved with clear and simple instructions.

	
  * Read our anti-spam measures to keep your contest fun and useful.

	
  * Check out our branding guidelines if you’re going to reference Pinterest in any way.




#### Don't:





	
  * Suggest that Pinterest sponsors or endorses you or the contest.

	
  * Require people to add Pins from a selection—let them add what they like.

	
  * Make people Pin your contest rules. This is a biggie.

	
  * Run a sweepstakes where each Pin, board, like or follow represents an entry.

	
  * Encourage spammy behavior, such as asking participants to comment.

	
  * Ask people to vote with Pins, boards, or likes.

	
  * Overdo it: contests can get old fast.

	
  * Require a minimum number of Pins. One is plenty.
