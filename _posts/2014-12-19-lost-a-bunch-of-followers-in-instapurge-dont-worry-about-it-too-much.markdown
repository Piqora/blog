<span>W</span>ell, the smoke is clearing after the #Instapurge.  Instagram had been warning its users for a while that they would be making a change to remove spammy accounts, and remove them they did. Big time, especially if you happen to be a celebrity. In the past 24 hours, [Justin Bieber lost 3.5 million followers, Akon lost more than a million](http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-rapture-claims-millions-of-celebrity-instagram-followers-2014-12#ixzz3MIACKDNo), while Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Rihanna, and even Oprah saw huge losses to their follower counts. Nor were celebrities the only ones who were impacted by the wholesale house cleaning; brands got hit as well. [PacSun](http://instagram.com/pacsun), for example, lost more than 100 thousand followers.

Honestly, this really isn't a bad thing; if anything, it should open the doors to more honest and genuine interactions and connections between fans and brands. Instagram states that this was done specifically to [remove spam accounts, or accounts that violated its community guidelines.](http://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-rapture-claims-millions-of-celebrity-instagram-followers-2014-12#ixzz3MIACKDNo) So brands that lost a lot of followers didn't likely lose any _real fans,_ or at least not many that were actively engaging with them._ _As we've said for a long time, [Follower Count shouldn't be the most important part of social media strategy](http://blog.piqora.com/follower-count-is-bullshit/). It's far more important for brands to engage with and encourage _action _from their fans, rather than simply have a lot of them. So if you have lost followers in the wake of #Instapurge, here's a few of our top recommendations to start getting them back, with interest!



	
  1. **Double Down On Your Existing Fans. **Focus on your existing relationships, rather than scrambling to replenish numbers. That means taking every opportunity to engage with them, and a great way to do that is...

	
  2. **Respond to All Comments on Your Instagram Content. **Evaluate all the comments that your fans are leaving on your posts, and respond to them whenever possible and appropriate. By doing so, you will foster real, meaningful relationships with your true fans. Furthermore, evaluate these comments and other indications of engagement, such as Likes on your posts. If people are engaging with your content, that means your content is _working_, and a good content strategy is the key to audience building.

	
  3. **Good Hashtagging Gets You in Front of Relevant Potential New Followers. **Hashtags are how people discover content on Instagram, and an [effective hashtag strategy is key to extending your reach.](http://go.piqora.com/instagram-hashtag-report.html) ** **At Piqora, our research has shown that [adding 7 hashtags to your posts can increase likes by up to 25 percent](http://blog.piqora.com/top-question-from-social-fresh-what-are-the-7-magic-hashtags/), and can help you gain visibility beyond your existing followers and grow your community.

	
  4. **Run a fun, Follow-Only Promotion. **Instagram photo contests are one of the fastest ways to build followers on the platform. A follow-only promotion has the lowest barrier to entry of any kind of contest, and generally the highest participation rate. Running a great promotion is a fast track to replacing those lost followers with new, genuine and real fans, so check out our [Guide to Instagram Photo Contests ](http://piqora.docalytics.com/v/guide_to_instagram_photo_contests_piqora)to find out how you can best harness these powerful tools!
