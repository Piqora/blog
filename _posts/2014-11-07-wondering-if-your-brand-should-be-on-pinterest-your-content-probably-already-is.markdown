So here’s a fundamental truth about Pinterest: more than 90% of Pins originate from websites, not from Pinterest profiles (by the way, if you want to take advantage of that stat and optimize your website for Pinning, [we have a guide for that!](http://go.piqora.com/rs/pinfluencer/images/Marketer%E2%80%99s%20Guide%20to%20Pinterest%20Website%20Optimization.pdf)) Millions of people Pin images from their favorite brands' websites every day, and as a result the majority of brand engagement on the platform actually happens outside of brands' owned Pinterest accounts.  While this might sound scary to marketers at first, it shouldn't; what this means is that people are anxious to engage with your brand, and Pinterest offers a huge opportunity to do just that.

Take auto makers, for example. While some car companies (like [Aston Martin](http://www.pinterest.com/astonmartin/), who have nearly 200,000 followers) are seeing huge success on Pinterest, many others aren't very active on the platform.

[BMW](http://instagram.com/bmw) for example has more than a million followers on Instagram, but they don't even have an official Pinterest profile. The story doesn't end there though, because a [quick Pinterest search reveals thousands of images devoted to their brand.](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=BMW&term_meta%5B%5D=BMW%7Ctyped)

Even car makers who are active on the network often see exponentially greater engagement outside of their own  profile. [Chevrolet](http://www.pinterest.com/Chevrolet/) for example has a great Pinterest profile, populated with more than 400 Pins. However, those pale in number to the[ thousands of images Chevy's fans have posted to the network](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=Chevrolet&term_meta%5B%5D=Chevrolet%7Ctyped). All these images being Pinned outside of Chevy's profile indicate an incredible level of brand engagement, and perfectly illustrate the power of Pinterest as a discovery platform.

This trend is certainly not unique to the auto industry. And while some brands might be concerned by all of these public conversations about their products happening outside of their control, they should actually be encouraged.  First of all, people generally Pin things they love or want to buy, so a Pin on Pinterest is a de-facto endorsement of your products or services. Secondly, interactions on Pinterest are **overwhelmingly positive**, especially when compared to networks like [Facebook and Twitter.](http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-and-instagram-thoughts-from-the-2014-social-media-insider-summit/)  So for brands that are proactive in engaging in these conversations, Pinterest offers a golden opportunity to foster meaningful, positive relationships with their fans and followers.
