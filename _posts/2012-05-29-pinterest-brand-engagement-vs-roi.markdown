Pinterest is the hot next-gen social network that has spawned a new lean-back browse behavior free of text. It offers complete visual immersion and click-based environment without the distraction of conversation. However, this power of Pinterest is not obvious to retailers and brands. What worked for the first generation networks such as facebook and twitter, does not work on Pinterest. There are critical differences between Pinterest and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com).



	
  1. **_Pinterest, unlike facebook, is not conversation centric._**

	
  2. **_Pinterest is optimized for discovery and browsing; not for consumer communication with brands._**

	
  3. **_Pinterest is not about hashtags or comments -- it's about product and inspiration discovery._**




**Pinterest != Facebook. ****Pinterest = ROI. **





## **3 big ways Pinterest drives clicks and ROI**




****1. Pinterest is another home for retailer's catalog -- created, curated and amplified (repinned) by your site's visitors. **Your traffic is pinning your content**; that content when seen by pinner's followers get repinned and multiples through the network.

2. When a site visitor pins your product - that creates distribution and click opportunities. The more pins your content gets, the more eyeballs and clicks to your product pages. _**Site visitors are distributors of product catalog and brand content.**_

3. For the very first time retailers have the _**ammunition of pins**_ to engage their casual visitors in a way that adds more customers in the funnel downstream. Pinterest is a viral loop with a very high K factor (viral co-efficient).

4. **Intent - **Pinterest is a sea of visuals and an average pinterest user visually parses a lot of images from the feed. If your product/pin got a click, it stood out from other images. **Clicks from [pinterest](http://pinterest.com) can be more 'considered' than from Facebook**. Facebook clicks are driven by curiosity about the friend, Pinterest clicks are about curiousity for the product.

5. Search still leads the way on intent. BUT since consumers are spending all their time on social networks - consumers are looking more and searching less, esp in impulse e-commerce categories.  _**In the age of Pinterest product catalogs have to find customers.**_

**Pinfluencer is a social CRM** and [Pinterest analytics](http://www.pinfluencer.com) product that helps companies connect with their brand advocates and influential users. For the first time, brands have the ability to reach out to visitors who indicated interest in a product - aka _**prospective buyers**_.
