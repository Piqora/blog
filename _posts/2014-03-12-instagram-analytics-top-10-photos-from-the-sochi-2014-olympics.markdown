Now that the dust has settled on the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi, it’s time to take a look at the Instagram analytics to find the photos & hashtags from the games that deserve a gold medal. Below are the 10 most liked Instagram photos that were tagged with #sochi, #olympics2014, or #sochi2014 (the official hashtag) — the 3 most used hashtags.

You may be surprised by the most popular photos on Instagram, since snowboards catching huge air, and medal ceremony images are absent, with group selfies and the opening ceremonies attracting some of the most likes:
