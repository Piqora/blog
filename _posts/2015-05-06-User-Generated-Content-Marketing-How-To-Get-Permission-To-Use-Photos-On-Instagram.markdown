So many marketers I’ve talked with recently – at our [San Francisco and New York mini-conferences on Visual Content Marketing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DYfu5NYyPs) – have said that doing more with user-generated photos is a priority. 

The big questions I keep hearing are, “What type of UGC should we be using?” and, “How do we get permission to the UGC photos we want to reuse?”

This post will attempt to answer each of those questions.

First up:

<h3>“What type of UGC should we be using?”</h3>

When you’re talking about user-generated photos for content marketing (pro tip: that’s what we’re talking about), there are three main types of UGC:

<h4>UGC images from bloggers and complimentary brands – this type of UGC, from influencers (who may or may not be paid), and friendly brands is great, but hard to build a strategy around.</h4>

Pros: Often very high quality, and increases exposure of your brand to the audiences of the blogger or friendly brand.

Cons: Not scalable. Unless you want to keep paying those blogger fees, or those brands are so friendly they’re OK to keep publishing for your brands benefit.

<h4>UGC images from a request or from a contest -- this type of UGC comes in bunches and is often pre-approved (according to the terms of your promotion).</h4>

Pros: You get to ask for exactly what you want, rights and permission to reuse are figured out in advance.

Cons: The quality level is varied since the users’ motivation was to win a prize.</li>

UGC images from individual users who feel a major connection to a brand, and include that brand’s hashtag – This is most meaningful type of UGC. It’s often the highest quality, and can be a clear indication of a user who’s a real brand advocate.

The natural next question is, “So how do we go from finding UGC from people who love our brand to getting permission to use it?”

I’m so glad you asked.

<h3>How To Get Permission To Use Photos On Instagram</h3>

There are 2 main types of permission that brands can get to be able to use customer user-generated photos from Instagram: implicit permission and explicit permission.

<h4>Implicit Permissions:</h4>

Implicit permissions are declarative statements or a general public notice where your brand says something like, “by using this #brandedhashtag you agree to our Terms Of Service and allow us as a brand to use the photo.”

This notice can be posted on your website, blog, or social profile.

Implicit permissions are great a way to secure blanket permissions for a lot of photos. In general, I usually recommend using your #brandhashtag for implicit permissions.

This allows your brand to get a supply of photos from your existing brand advocates and customers, relatively easily. 

Just be sure to given attribution to the photo creator and link back to the original Instagram photo URL.

<h4>Explicit Permissions:</h4>

Explicit permission is when your brand reaches out to someone who posted a photo you want to get permission to reuse, and that person responds with a message that expresses consent.

Piqora’s rights messaging system can help your brand do this 1:1 reach out at scale by enabling you to personalize an Instagram comment asking for permission that the Instagram member can simply respond to with a comment that includes #yes<brand>.

Your brand message also contains a link to your Terms of Service. If that Instagram member responds with a “yes<brand>” hashtag, then Piqora’s UGC permission system will moves the image to the UGC-approved area of your photo library.

Hopefully this post has made the concept of UGC photos and permissions more clear. If you still have any questions, please reach out – [we’re always happy to chat](http://www.piqora.com/get-a-demo/) in more detail about how to find, acquire, and publish UGC.
