[![#piqorachat Twitter chat](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-29-at-2.06.02-PM-300x300.png)](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-29-at-2.06.02-PM.png)
We'll be hosting a series of Twitter chats, starting **Wednesday, October 8 at 12pm PT/3pm ET** for social marketers about how to be effective on visual networks like Pinterest and Instagram. During each chat we'll share actionable data, insights, and research about the visual web to help make marketing on these networks a little bit easier (and your results a little better).

So, obviously we get a lot of questions from marketers about the most effective strategies on Instagram and Pinterest for their brand. It's really true that finding the right visual web strategy is like solving a puzzle. Which is cool, because connecting with other marketers on an individual level to help solve their Instagram and Pinterest challenges is one of my favorite parts of working here. It's also why we decided to host these Twitter chats, to talk about these networks, why we love them, and why we think marketers should love them too [even more than Facebook].

The topic of this first [**#piqorachat**](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=piqorachat&src=typd) will be **Halloween promotions on Instagram and Pinterest**. If you just can't wait until the chat to learn more tactics and best practices, you can get the [Marketer's Guide To Halloween Promotions](http://go.piqora.com/halloween-marketers-guide.html?LS=blog) right now.

_Huge Bonus:_ we're excited to have Kelly Lieberman, social media manager and founder of the #pinchat Pinterest chat, join us as co-host for our first ever [**#piqorachat**](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=piqorachat&src=typd). Kelly's popular #pinchat takes place on Wednesday nights at 6pm PT/9pm ET and inspired us to start our own ongoing dialogue with social media mangers about Instagram and Pinterest. Find Kelly on Twitter at [@Tribe2point0](https://twitter.com/Tribe2point0) and on Pinterest [here](http://www.pinterest.com/kellylieberman).
