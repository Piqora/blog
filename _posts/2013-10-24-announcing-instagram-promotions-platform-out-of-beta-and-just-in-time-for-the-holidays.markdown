We're delighted to announce that our Instagram Promotions and Tracking platform is out of beta! Like with Pinterest, promotions are hands down the most effective way to build your audience on Instagram, and without exception the most successful Instagram promotions are powered by robust backend software like ours. Instagram is hot hot hot, and with the holidays upon us there's never been a better time to build your community with promotions.

Want to take a peak under the hood? Check out the results from Pilperlime’s Booties and Besties promotion. They gained hundreds of new followers, reached tens of thousands of users, and generated a ton of valuable UGC – and their promotion was up and running in less than an hour.
