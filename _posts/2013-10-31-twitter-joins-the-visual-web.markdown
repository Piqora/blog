Twitter just made their [timeline visual](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/picture-this-more-visual-tweets) with previews of images and short videos from Vine. And in doing so it joins the ranks of Pinterest, Instagram and Tumblr making Visual Web a very large composite social network with over 400 million users across age and sex demographics that are consuming media via self-selected in-stream images.

We are not surprised by this. First generation social networks are becoming visual. They have to. Today's mobile and tablet consumers are very visual. The form factor of the devices and the fat internet pipes are fueling this shift.<!-- more -->

Twitter's new visual timeline will not only make the app more mainstream (Pinterest's most engaged user base is in midwest) but might also drive more engagement and publishing from its current set of users. Here are 5 reasons this is significant for social and visual media marketers.



	
  1. Tweets with images will get more re-tweets, favorites and clicks.

	
  2. It's no longer about just text tweeting. If you want higher engagement, re-tweets and click throughs, you'll have to include a relevant image with click-appeal to go with your tweet. Which means more work and more thought.

	
  3. Brand Marketers can drive meaningful visual impressions and brand recall with image tweets.

	
  4. Image analytics becomes even more important. Marketers will need to analyze images that generate engagement and clicks. And use and reuse those types of images.

	
  5. Retailers - eventually tweet button on your site will function like a pin-it button -- transmitting the product image along with the tweet and link. Analyze which products are getting shared on twitter and which are driving traffic back to your website.


Images are replacing links as traffic sources. It's no longer enough to know your link sources on Google Analytics. You have to know which _**images**_ are responsible for visits to your website. Images not links are becoming the DNA of Web Analytics.
