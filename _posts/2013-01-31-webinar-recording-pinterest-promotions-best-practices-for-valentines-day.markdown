On Tuesday January 29th, we hosted a webinar to discuss Best practices in Pinterest Promotions, just in time for the Valentine's Day Holiday. On the webinar, our Head of Customer Success, Alex Littlewood, presented ways for marketers to:











	
  * Harness the financial power of the #3 US spending holiday by driving Pinterest activity and e-commerce.

	
  * Launch a promotion in 3 days, with the best possible user experience for participants.

	
  * Save hours in management and tracking of participants using our best-in-Class promotions tracking technology.
