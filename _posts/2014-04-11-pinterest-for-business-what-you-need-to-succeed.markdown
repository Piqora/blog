Pinterest is the best social network for marketers to spend time on. Every pin has the potential to drive traffic back to your website, and our research shows that pins on Pinterest continue driving traffic for a long time: [50% of traffic comes after 3 months](http://go.piqora.com/Q4-2013-Pinterest-Study.html). Facebook and Twitter posts are visible to your audience for a matter of hours. Top performing content there stays up for a day, maybe.

If you're reading this you probably already know about Pinterest's traffic and revenue driving potential and want to know how to improve your business's results from Pinterest. Well, here you go, below are Piqora's best resources for mastering Pinterest marketing:


## First Things First: Why Pinterest Marketing?


To get buy-in from management at your company to start spending more time on Pinterest marketing, consider showing them this whitepaper: [Pinterest: The Social ROI Holy Grail](http://go.piqora.com/SocialROIHolyGrailLP.html). It covers the ways that Pinterest can drive real financial ROI in ways other networks canâ€™t. A great way to start the conversation within your team.


## Step 2: Learn What Works on Pinterest


While creating & curating boards on Pinterest is the best "active learning" approach to finding out what works, you can accelerate your learning curve with some data-driven best practice guides:

1. [Quantitative Study of Brands on Pinterest](http://go.piqora.com/Q4-2013-Pinterest-Study.html) - get this guide to see how often you should be pinning and how to set up your website to increase pins.

2. [Guide To Pin-Optimizing Your Website](http://go.piqora.com/PinUXOptimizationLP.html) - this guide shows you how to optimize images on your site for pinning. 

3. [Secrets to Successful Pinterest Promotions](http://go.piqora.com/SecretstoSuccessfulPromotionsLP.html) - When you're ready for your first contest, get this primer to Pinterest promotions, then check out more posts about [best practices for Pinterest promotions](http://blog.piqora.com/tag/pinterest-promotions/).


## Step 3: Time for Pinterest Analytics


Once you've published 20+ boards, added the "Pin It!" button to your site, and see in Google Analytics that traffic is trending up, it's time to start measuring results, iterating, and improving. [Pinterest's own analytics module](http://business.pinterest.com/analytics/) is where to start. It enables you to track activity and learn what pinners like.
