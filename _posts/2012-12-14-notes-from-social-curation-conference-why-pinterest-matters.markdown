[Pinfluencer](http://www.pinfluencer.com) participated in a panel at the social curation summit in LA and we shared our thoughts why Pinterest really matters.



	
  1. Pinterest is a network of visual and sharable hyperlinks. Links are the fundamental building blocks of the internet. All distribution and monetization on internet happens via links.

	
  2. Pinterest makes those links human.

	
  3. Those visual links are actually products, experiences and objects that people want to collect and share.

	
  4. The visual link collections and sharing create a happy viral loop between your website and pinterest.

	
  5. That happy viral loop drives recurring traffic and sales ($$).

	
  6. And that's why marketers and businesses should care about Pinterest.
