Digital marketing has been evolving since early 2000s and so are the marketing workflows designed to help marketers create, distribute and measure content performance across those digital marketing channels. Brands are increasingly looking to connect with consumers via authentic imagery on multiple digital and social channels and the workflows that were designed to deliver programmatic paid creative executions are no longer sufficient to deliver on the promise of smart, engaging and ROI driven image based content marketing. 

<h3>Content is the atomic unit of marketing</h3>
Marketing workflows are a step by step software that facilitates multiple users to collaborate and communicate on content creation and sharing. For digital advertisers, this content is advertising creative to support paid media workflows - with design teams, media buying teams, brand management and agency account teams collaborating together on the execution of that paid media campaign. For content marketers content is -- a UGC photo, a pinterest pin, a fashion lookbook, an influencer blog -- that needs to be collected, curated, published and measured from a single platform.

<h3>Discovery & Curation execution vs. Creative executionz</h3>
Modern content marketing workflows are distinct from creative execution workflows and center around content discovery, curation, smart publishing and results based recommendations. They are less about a lot of people approving and controlling the creative and more about understanding what your audience likes on different channels, finding the content to support the engagement, collaborate on a content calendar, and continuously learning from results to optimize future publishing. Successful content marketing is about consistent and relevant storytelling not sporadic campaign executions. 

Best content marketing workflows are specialized and focus on certain media types and particular channels. For e.g. even within social - facebook and twitter marketing is largely paid advertising or sponsored posts, the focus is on customer service and hence the workflows designed for facebook are built around campaign and creative execution and customer response. 

<h3>High volume and high ROI publishing requires workflow automation</h3>
Visual channels such as Pinterest - require a consistent and relevant pinning at the rate of 20-30 pins a day. With that kind of volume, the workflows need to be smart and provide both recommendations and automation to enable social marketers publish at scale. Visual marketing workflows are also much more about driving commerce, come with the component of discovery and integration of shoppable UGC photos on websites and digital magazines.
