Following the success of our [Pinterest Promotions best practices](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/pinterest-contests-and-sweepstakes-webinar-by-pinfluencer/) webinar, our head of customer success, Alex Littlewood, decided to shed some light on what data to measure on Pinterest (hint: influential pinners, top pins, viral boards, competitive insights :)), how to use those measurements to grow and engage Pinterest audience and finally how to put a dollar value on Pinterest actions and Pinterest users. All of that intelligence is captured in the webinar video below. Check it out and email us at hello@pinfluencer.com if you have any questions. Follow us at @pinfluencer on twitter to get updates on future webinars.
