[Holidays are huge on Pinterest and Instagram](http://blog.piqora.com/top-tips-for-halloween-promotions-video/), and Thanksgiving is no different. How big of a deal is Thanksgiving? Here are a few quick stats:



	
  * Last year, [online shopping on Cyber Monday](http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/11/20/cyber_monday_adi.html) hit $2.29 billion in sales, up 16 percent year-over-year. This is a good indicator that online shopping sales will continue to increase this year.

	
  * During the Thanksgiving holiday last year, $150M in revenue came from social media. Pinterest saw a 17% year-over-year growth, and is continuing to grow.

	
  * According to our research, compared to a 30-day average preceding Thanksgiving, revenue from Pinterest was **up by 2x over the Thanksgiving weekend and on Black Friday**, and **up by** **3.6x on Cyber Monday. **


From [recipes and decoration ideas on Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=thanksgiving&term_meta%5B%5D=thanksgiving%7Ctyped) to Black Friday promotions, Thanksgiving provides an excellent opportunity for brands to connect with their communities. And to help brands get the most out of the holiday, our marketing team got their heads together for a round table discussion about the top things brands should know about Thanksgiving on Pinterest and Instagram.

If you don't have time to watch the video, here are some of the key takeaways we discussed:



	
  * If you're considering launching a Thanksgiving promotion on Pinterest or Instagram, it's important to launch the promo early and promote it heavily on all of your available social channels.

	
  * Thanksgiving promotions specifically provide opportunities to inspire online and encourage your audience to take offline action. For example, a promotion around Thanksgiving decorating not only gets people Pinning, but being creative in real life when putting together their table decorations.

	
  * It's critical to think outside the box -- you don't have to be a food or home decor brand to launch a Thanksgiving promotion. It's a holiday that all brands can relate to.


These are just a few of the things we discuss in the video. If you want to learn more about developing a Pinterest strategy for this holiday season, please join us on [Thursday, November 13 at 10am PT for a live webinar.](http://go.piqora.com/holiday-pinterest-webinar.html) During this webinar, we'll show you how Pinterest can help brands and retailers connect with their customers in authentic, engaging ways during the holidays. Happy Thanksgiving!!
