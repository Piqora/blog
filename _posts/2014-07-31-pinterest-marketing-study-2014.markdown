[![Revenue Per Pin](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg)](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/unnamed.jpg)

According to data pulled from more than 400 Piqora customers, **the average Revenue-per-Pin grew 67% from January to June 2014. **Pinterest is driving more revenue than ever before. In addition to increased revenue, we've seen that the average value of e-commerce orders grew **8.3%** and the conversion rate grew **4%**. For large e-commerce brands that are active on Pinterest, these increases represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in incremental revenue.


## What is Revenue-per-Pin?


Revenue-per-Pin is a metric that is a part of the Piqora Pinterest marketing dashboard. The metric is calculated by using the number of pins that a brand publishes on Pinterest divided by the total revenue from Pinterest referral traffic. Data from this study is based on brands who have connected their Google Analytics, Omniture or Coremetrics account to Piqora.

In addition to discovering new products and brands on Pinterest, consumers are increasingly buying the products they find.

What Revenue-per-Pin metric helps answer is the frequently asked question, “What is the ROI of social?”



## Yep, Pinterest Referral Traffic is Growing Too.



Overall referral traffic from Pinterest has grown significantly. The average Visit-per-Pin increased **172%** and the average Pageviews-per-Pin jumped **304%** over the same time period.

This shows each pin is driving more traffic back to brands' websites and each visitor is viewing significantly more products than ever before. Yeah, that's pretty exciting.

“Brands are looking for real ROI from their marketing efforts and Pinterest delivers just that. Not only are marketers achieving a tremendous branding footprint via pins and repins, but they are also able to drive traffic with purchase intent. Brands will continue to prioritize and rigorously track business metrics like revenue and traffic, not only follower counts – which is exactly what Piqora helps brands accomplish,” said Piqora CEO Sharad Verma.
