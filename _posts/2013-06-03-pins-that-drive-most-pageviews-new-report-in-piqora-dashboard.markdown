Our customers often asked us - which pins were driving the most pageviews and time-spent on site? We recently launched a report that lets you see you pins that drove the most number of pageviews in the Pins tab. Similar to top pins by visits report, these are actually de-duped images by our image recognition algorithm that kept the pinners longer on your website.

Pageviews drive discovery of products and content on your website and knowing which images that drive that stickiness can help you design your boards and inform your on-site merchandizing. Use higher time ranges - like past 30 days -- when reading the Top-Pins-By-Pageviews report. Longer time period will help you see clear patterns and minimize the noise. For e.g. "Red high heel shoes" cause your users to stay longer on your site and click more. Pin those sticky images on your boards and maximize your ROI from Pinterest visits.

In order to see this report, you need to have hooked up Google Analytics, Omniture or Coremetrics from the Metrics tab. We have got more reports coming up! Email us at hello@piqora.com if you want a demo of Piqora's Visual Analytics for Pinterest.
