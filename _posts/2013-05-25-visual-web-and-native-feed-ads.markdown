Visual Web is a collection of interest based networks that are emerging as havens for visual discovery of products. On visual networks like Pinterest, Polyvore, Houzz, Tumblr -- the best of web is getting collected in a very visual way and is coming to users in their visual feeds. Visual Feeds is the current and the future of e-commerce discovery.

Visual networks make web browsing extremely efficient. Users can see a lot of products easily and judge whether they want to click through making the outbound clicks from these networks very qualified. At scale this shifts the time-spent on web pages away to visual feeds as the users will come to the immersive experience of the feed if the web page didn't have what they were looking for. This shift in time-spent will decrease the reach and efficacy of display ads for e-commerce.

Visual Feeds will gradually replace sub-optimal IAB display ads as _the_ way for an e-commerce brand to attract shoppers to its website. These visual networks have their own native advertising formats -- Promoted posts on Facebook, Promoted Tweets, Promoted Tumbles etc and brands would augment their owned media from organic curation with paid native media on these platforms to enhance visibility on these user feeds.

Native Ads are successful as they offer a great UX and flip advertising on its head; while traditional display ads are designed brand-first, native ads are designed audience and network first. Successful native ads are about designer content marketing built with the channel and audience behavior on that channel in mind.

Native Visual Feed Ads offer earned media amplification (unlike their IAB counterparts), self-selected intent targeting and necessitate the rise of Visual Feed Ad Exchanges to act as the layer on top of native advertising formats of multiple visual networks and enable brands to buy native media on these visual feed networks.

The social-mobile shift continues to deepen with 61% of the users now accessing the networks over mobile. This number is expected to rise to 88% by 2017 according to emarketer. Visual content is the most engaging and performing form on the social-mobile web. Traditional display ads are least effective in this visual-social-mobile environment and are giving way to Native Feed Ads as the primary way for these mobile focussed visual networks to monetize and enable brands to target users based on their self-selection and curation behavior.
