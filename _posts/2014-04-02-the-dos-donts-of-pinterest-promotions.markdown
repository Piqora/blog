The single best way to grow your brand’s Pinterest community, get thousands of meaningful pins, and drive traffic to both your Pinterest profile and website is to launch a Pinterest promotion. Below are the most important "Do's & Don'ts" for Pinterest promotions that Piqora has developed by powering over 600 promotions (well over 600 million impressions), with simple hosting options that enable brands to easily turn website traffic, email lists, and social channels into Pinterest followers and avid pinners.




One of the most significant Do's is of course keeping up with Pinterest's promotion guidelines. This is because in October 2013 Pinterest updated their [promotion guidelines](http://business.pinterest.com/brand-guidelines/) to help fight spammy behavior and provide a better experience for pinners. Here at Piqora, we stay up to date with the latest changes to ensure these guidelines are aligned in every promotion we power so that the relationship between your brand and Pinterest isn’t compromised.




We’ve outlined Pinterest’s most significant changes when running a promotion with some examples of what you can do below:

## **Don’t:** Ask for Repins or Give Users a Selection to Pin From




Pinterest is a place where people are inspired by the things they love. Requiring them to pin from a selection (be it Pinterest profile, board, website or brand) limits the potential inspiration a pinner can have. Technically, they could upload an image of their choice and should still be considered eligible to win for your contest.




What you can do: Instead of saying, “Repin your favorite Spring styles from our Spring Style Board,” say “Pin your favorite Spring Styles with inspiration from our Spring Style Board.” Or, make it even simpler by just saying “Pin your favorite Spring Styles.” After a pinner enters the promotion, they are taken directly to your brand’s profile, board or website (you choose). You’ll assume they’ll begin pinning from there and not venture off to find other material that inspires them to enter your contest.

## **Do: **Require One Entry Per User & No Pin Minimums




You can’t require a minimum number of pins to be created in order to be eligible for the contest, nor can additional pins/likes/comments/follows count as extra entries.


What you can do: Suggest that the pinners pin in the plural - their favorite recipe**s**, wedding dresse**s** or bathing suit**s** - implying the more the merrier.


## **Don’t: **Call Your Contest “Pin It to Win It”




You can’t require users to pin only your products or content in order to win the prize.




What you can do: You can call your promotion a “Pin to Win” because they have pin something in order to enter the contest.


You can still giveaway your product, but make sure they aren’t required to pin the product to win it.


## **Don't: **Other Rules to Keep in Mind**






	
  * 


Don’t suggest that Pinterest endorses or is involved with your promotion.




	
  * 


Don’t ask for users to vote with pins, likes, comments or boards.




	
  * 


Don’t ask for comments or hashtags on your pin content. You can ask that they include a comment or hashtag on their own pins, but don’t make them post on yours.




	
  * 


Don’t require entrants to pin your contest rules.







## **Do: **Plan Your Next Pinterest Promotion




Following these rules you can run extremely successful Pinterest promotions. The two best performing promotions that Piqora has powered (>150,000 pins created) were launched after the guideline update. The last "don't" is don't let these discourage you from running an promotional campaign on Pinterest.
