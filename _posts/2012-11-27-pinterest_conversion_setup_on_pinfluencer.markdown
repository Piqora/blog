Earlier this month [Pinfluencer launched ROI tracking for pins](http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/pinfluencer-launches-pin-roi-tracking-system-for-pinterest-supports-integration-with-google-analytics-omniture-coremetrics/) via its industry leading integrations with all major web analytics providers - Google Analytics, Adobe's SiteCatalyst (Omniture) and Coremetrics. This allows brands to see metrics such as Revenue/Pin, Visits/Pin and reports such as Top pins by revenue, Top pins by visits etc. These metrics put dollar value on your pinterest presence and measure the true ROI of your investment in Pinterest. The set up does not require any pixel or tag integration on your website and with a few simple steps you can start seeing these ROI metrics and pin-to-purchase reports on your Pinfluencer dashboard.<!-- more -->
