Pinterest is gradually rolling out ['News' feature](https://help.pinterest.com/entries/22948646). The Activity tab is going to be phased out and replaced with the 'News' tab. The feature is designed to boost content discovery. It will show the boards into which pins are going  -- allowing users to easily discover new boards and also perhaps increase reciprocal following.




Brands and marketers are looking for ways to scale audience on pinterest, boost following and generate engagement. The advent of 'News' feature can dramatically board discovery for brands that employ repinning as their engagement strategy. A great way to increase the number of high quality followers on Pinterest is to engage pinterest users that are already pinning a lot from your website (pinfluencer dashboard provides that report).  Now with the "News" feature this repinning will increase the visibility of brand's boards on the News tab of Pinterest users, resulting in more followers and increased number of repins of their board content driving traffic, sales and product awareness.




Of course, it is not yet clear if pinterest users discover content by going to their profile page. Our experience suggests that majority of pin discovery happens on user's feed and category pages. Of course, Pinterest can embed 'News' content into the weekly email causing brand's boards to shop in user's inbox. That would be amazing, isn't it! The diagram below sums it up.
