In one very [first blog post](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/pinterest-brand-engagement-vs-roi/) we talked about the viral value of a site visitor and how it leads to a tight

If your website is optimized for pinning, each new site visitor can drive a ton of incremental traffic via the very fertile pinterest's viral loop. Pinterest is an interest-graph where users follow taste-makers and where your _site visitors pin organically from your website creating viral distribution of your __products_. Here are the 5 simple steps you can take to convert your site visitors into pinners and generate new social traffic to your website.




## 1. Install Pin-it Button

Some of Pinfluencer's customers have seen 40% of their pins originating from the pin-it button (remaining 60% from pinterest's bookmarklet). 40% is a huge share!. Also Pinterest is expanding beyond it's early adopters and not very many internet users are savvy with bookmarklets. Internet users are used to seeing facebook and twitter shares and a new pin-it button involves no learning curve for your audience.<!-- more -->


## 2. Make sure your Pin-it Button is Above-the-Fold


Above the fold is the technical term for what your users see before scrolling the page. Most users browse very quickly and are not always scrolling. If your site visitors can't see the pin-it button, it is practically non-existent. Keeping the pin-it button where your users can see it without scrolling is a great way to sure your users can engaged with the button and pin easily.


## 3. Consider overlaying the pin-it button on your product/content images

Images attract all the attention and create the eyeball fixation effect. When your user is engrossed in an image - that is the time to subtly remind that the image is pinnable and has been pinned by many other users creating social proof and validation. On Pinterest too, the images a.k.a pins have the repin, like and comment buttons right on the image itself.


## 4. Auto populate product description in the pin-it button code

Pinners are lazy and don't always tag the pins with right description. As a marketer you want to stay in control and make sure that every product-copy a.k.a pin/repin has all the information in the pin caption available for pinterest users to drive considered clicks. Auto suggesting product description is a great way to do it -- it helps the pinners and helps with your product goals. These descriptions will also come in handy when pinterest implements a robust search engine on its site.


## 5. Auto populate price in the pin caption (e-commerce only)

If you are an e-commerce marketer, auto populating price can _sometimes_ be a good way to attract pinterest users who are in the buying mode. Pinterest puts the price as a corner ribbon on the pins and attracts bottom-funnel buyers who find the price attractive. Now this may not work in every situation esp. for very expensive products. **Our advise: test auto price inclusion for products with different price ranges and use [pinfuencer analytics](http://www.pinfluencer.com) to track clicks and decide which price segment is best for auto price sharing.**


## 6. Bonus: Link your Pinterest profile on your website

[![](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/followonp.png)](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/followonp.png)Tell your site visitors about your pinterest presence. Ask them to follow you. Linking your pinterest boards from your website is also a great SEO tactic and boosts the rank of your pinterest profile on the search engines.
