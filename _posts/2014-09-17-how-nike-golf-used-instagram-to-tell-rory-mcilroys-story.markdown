The world’s No. 1 golfer, Rory McIlroy, has had quite the summer. McIlroy, who is one of Nike’s highest paid athletes, sported the swoosh on his way to an impressive victory back in July at the British Open in Hoylake, England, in what was a career-defining moment for the 25-year-old from Northern Ireland.

But McIlroy wasn’t done, and he vowed to keep pushing for success in 2014. "I'm enjoying being the Open champion, but that's not all I want to be this year," [McIlroy told reporters](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pgatour.com%2Ftourreport%2F2014%2F07%2F29%2Frory-mcilroy--a-lot-more-to-achieve-this-year.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHeBK2g7vv3JPdc7tR-uaBS8omIow). "I want to do more.”

Just days after his victory, Nike Golf profiled the young phenom by posting a series of six images throughout the day using #DontSleepOnSummer, which Nike Golf had been using throughout the summer to encourage golfers to get out and improve their skills.

In a post featuring Rory working out, he wore a Nike shirt that read #WinningStartsHere. Talk about making a social marketer’s job easy!

The feature wrapped up with a more intimate look at Rory: the sixth and final post featured him putting barefoot in his backyard, as an inflatable crocodile watched with wide-eyed admiration. Of course Rory was decked out in Nike gear, and I’ve highlighted an exchange where Nike responds directly in the comments thread to fans asking where they can purchase exactly what Rory is wearing.

This series of images gave Nike Golf’s Instagram followers a never before seen perspective on Rory’s life outside the ropes and highlighted his commitment to continued success.

Nike Golf did an excellent job with this feature and accumulated over 46,000 "likes" and 509 comments. But you don’t need to sponsor world famous athletes to execute something similar. Could you choose a superfan and profile their unique use of your products throughout the day? Do you have a particularly interesting fashion designer you could feature? What about featuring a model who's showing off your line in a tropical jungle?

Be creative, and feel free to have a little fun in the process.
