It turns out that for Instagram photo contests, a huge prize doesn’t necessarily guarantee massive participation. In our recently completed study of 100 Instagram photo contests, the largest prize offered was valued at several thousand dollars, which generated fewer than 100 participants. In fact, of the top 10 performing contests (ranked by participation), only three offered a prize valued at $1000 or more, and the rest were significantly less than that.  This might sound counterintuitive, especially for brands with experience running promotions on Pinterest, where prizes valued at between $1000-$5000 generate 3x more participation than prizes valued at $500-$1000, and 5x more than prizes worth less than $500. On Instagram, however, the landscape is much different.

We aren’t saying that the prize isn’t a factor for a successful promotion. The average value of a contest reward on Instagram is about $850, and while sometimes going above that benchmark can pay off big, there are other elements that will play a much bigger role in the success of your promotions, such as:

**Having Clear Objectives and Designing Your Contest to Reach Them**

The results of your contest are dictated to a huge degree by how you design it, and what you want it to achieve. For example, if your goal is maximum participants, choose an appealing, brand appropriate theme with a catchy hashtag, ask entrants to take a selfie anytime, anywhere, and tell them that the winner of the contest will be selected at random. Why? Because all of these factors create a low barrier for entry.

By selecting a brand appropriate theme and a unique, memorable hashtag, entrants will clearly understand the style of images your brand wants for your contest and will remember how to submit them. Selfies are the easiest type of of picture to take, especially if you don’t require them to be taken at a particular time of day, location, or with anyone else. And a randomly selected winner signals to participants that simply entering the contest ensures they have just as good of a chance of winning as anyone else.   On the other hand, if your goal is to utilize your contest to source great quality UGC, your approach should be different. For example, having a judged contest is a great way to nudge up the quality of photo entries, as participants know that in order to win, they will have to come up with more creative pictures than anyone else.  A few other things to bear in mind that can make a major difference in designing your contests include:

- The vast majority of Instagrammers are Millennials (more than 90% of Instagram’s user base is under the age of 35), so if you are targeting them make sure your creative is edgy and interesting.

- “Selfies” have the lowest barrier to entry, as they are the easiest to take, while photos that involve other people, are time-of-day or location dependent (i.e. sunsets, moons, landmarks) are naturally more difficult.

- Sweepstakes are best for maximum participation numbers, but if you’re after great quality UGC, judged contests are the way to go. - Long-running contests should have a place in your overall contest and community strategy but should not be overdone, as they can lead to fatigue.

**Your Audience, and How You Promote Your Contest **

Cross-promoting your Instagram contests across all of your social channels is one of the most powerful tools for fostering success. Doing so at the beginning of your contest and several times throughout aids performance and is a great way to encourage your fans on other networks to follow your brand on Instagram. And while having a big existing audience is a distinct advantage, the power of cross promotion is universal, as evidenced by the fact that a contest ran by a brand with roughly 1300 Instagram followers and 500,000 Facebook fans was able to generate more participation than a one with more than 1,000,000 Instagram followers and 21,000,000 Facebook fans. Here are some other great ways to create buzz around your Instagram contest:

- On the first day of your contest, post an image with your contest’s official rules and entry requirements.

- While Instagram is mobile dominated, you should design your contest creative in such a way that it can be used on web landing pages and as a post on Instagram and Twitter

- Post a high quality photo of your contest prize with a caption explaining the rules and other contest details; this is a great resource for entrants to refer back to if they have questions about your contest.

- Temporarily update your Instagram bio during your contest to include a call to action, your contest hashtag, and any links that are relevant to your contest. Doing so notifies anyone who visits your Instagram profile of your contest, and can help drive more entries.

**A Great Hashtag**   Hashtags are critical for successful instagram contests. They help people find your contest and build conversations around it, and they are the vehicle by which your fans submit their entries. While you can’t “own” a hashtag on Instagram (or any other social network for that matter), it pays to take time to select a hashtag that isn’t likely to be used by anyone else. If your hashtag isn’t unique and distinctive, your contest can fade into the background noise of larger conversations. Additionally, you run the risk of picking a winner who just happened to use that hashtag for some other purpose, and wasn’t really a contest participant.   Choosing the right hashtag doesn’t have to be complicated. Just remember that you’re asking fans to type it into their mobile devices each time they snap a photo to participate. Making your hashtags catchy and easy to remember will help you maximize the number of entries your contest receives. Some key learnings from our hashtag research include:

- Incorporate your brand’s slogan, or if appropriate, abbreviate your brand name (i.e Lululemon becomes #Lulu)

- Incorporate the name of your contest, i.e What Are Your Habits? becomes #thisismyhabit

- Use dates and places for campaigns at live events (i.e., #SFGiantsGame6)

- Investing in a hashtag tracking tool can greatly enhance effective contest management

Photo contests are an awesome tool for building audiences, increasing brand visibility, and tapping into original, highly creative user-generated content on Instagram.
