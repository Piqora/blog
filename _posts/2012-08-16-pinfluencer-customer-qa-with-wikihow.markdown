As part of the customer Q&A series on [Pinterest Analytics](http://www.pinfluencer.com/), Pinfluencer spoke with wikihow marketing director, Thom Scher.[![](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thom.jpeg)](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/thom.jpeg)


## **Why is Pinterest important to Wikihow?**




<blockquote>The web is becoming increasingly visual and Pinterest is a prime example of how important stunning visuals are! Pinterest is its own community, and wikiHow is able to create specific boards to serve a wide variety of peoples' needs. Pinterest (and social media more broadly) is a great place to interact with people who are using our how-to guides. wikiHow's mission is to create the most helpful how-to content anywhere. Our editors are constantly improving each article until we think it's the highest quality how-to guide on that topic. One of the ways we can determine if we hit the mark is to see how people react to our articles on Pinterest, and that is where Pinfluencer comes in.</blockquote>







## **Why did you start using Pinfluencer?**




<blockquote>wikiHow started using Pinfluencer in order to better understand what our Pinterest followers want to see from us. Not surprisingly, _what they want is quite different than what our Facebook fans or Twitter followers want_! Pinfluencer allows us to examine what is most interesting for Pinterest users, what does well with our Pinterest followers, and what areas we can work to improve on. Sometimes it is easy to predict articles that will do well on Pinterest, but other times Pinfluencer can really help; we would have never guessed that [http://www.wikihow.com/Type-Symbols-Using-the-ALT-Key](http://www.wikihow.com/Type-Symbols-Using-the-ALT-Key) [![](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/altkey-300x150.png)](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/altkey.png)would be popular on Pinterest, but it has been a huge hit!<!-- more --></blockquote>







## **What feature(s) do you use the most?**




<blockquote>WikiHow uses the "most popular pins" feature to track what is doing well with our Pinterest audience. We also use the "influential & active followers" feature to make sure that we're interacting with our top fans! Sometimes things do exceptionally well on Pinterest that don't do as well as on Facebook or Twitter (such as [http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Mildew-Smell-from-Towels](http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-Mildew-Smell-from-Towels) or [http://www.wikihow.com/Dye-Hair-With-Kool-Aid](http://www.wikihow.com/Dye-Hair-With-Kool-Aid)) -- the Pinfluencer tools help us identify those articles and pin them to our boards.</blockquote>







## **What business/market insights have you gained since using Pinfluencer?**




<blockquote>We've gained a ton of insight into our _brand's impact across various Pinterest categories,_ and been able to look into how our visual content does against other content published to Pinterest. It's fantastic to be able to compare pins and boards, and then to be able to modify what we pin.</blockquote>







## **Do you have any favorite pins that are on Wikihow's Pinterest page? **




<blockquote>wikiHow to Make Bacon Cups![![](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/bacon-300x225.jpeg)](http://pinterest.com/pin/142848619401683939/)</blockquote>
