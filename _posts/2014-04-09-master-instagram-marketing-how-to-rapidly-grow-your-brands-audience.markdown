Instagram is the fastest growing social media network on the planet. For brands, the potential to get close to your targeted audience with inspiring visual content is there, but very few brands have been able to establish a great presence. Why?

The truth is that it's not a walk in the park. Successful [Instagram marketing](https://www.piqora.com/products/instagram) takes a lot of creativity and some specific knowledge. This post will help you with the latter. While difficult, there are some clear steps that you can take to start increasing the size of your audience on Instagram. Here are a few things to focus on:


## 1. Focus on your Hashtags


Including relevant hashtags in your Instagram posts are a must to grow your audience. I know what you're thinking: "But I don't want to create a spammy feel for our followers." No one is suggesting that you include 492 hashtags, but [Piqora's original research](https://www.piqora.com/resources) proves that including just 3 hashtags on your posts can increase your number of likes on that individual post by up to **110%**. Including **5** hashtags can increase it by **180%** per post.

Our research suggests that using **7** hashtags in a given post is optimal, and brands are drastically underusing hashtags as a general rule. Nearly **30%** of posts have no hashtags, while more than half average one or less. Adding just three can result in huge gains, but only **10%** of brands are doing so. Only **4%** of brands are using the recommended **5 to 7** in each post. Separate yourselves from the pack! Hashtags are imperative to increasing your discoverability on Instagram.

Rather than simply hashtagging the name of your brand, learn which hashtags your target audience is already using regularly and add them whenever it makes sense. You can use Piqora to track popular hashtags on Instagram and see who's posting regularly within your brand's key categories (i.e. fitness, fashion, health).


## 2. Follow Prominent Users, Like their Content


Nowadays, identifying your biggest and most influential brand ambassadors is a relatively common initiative. Understanding what content these individuals are engaging with can provide brands with excellent insight into how their products are being received. 

The power of peer-to-peer recommendations is remarkable, and as a brand you can go beyond simply identifying those brand ambassadors. Follow them back, "like" their content, and make them feel like you genuinely care about them. This seems simple, but the authentic act of following key users and engaging with them is huge. Build those relationships!


## 3. Post Regularly, Be Interesting


On top of including **5-7** hashtags on your posts, you should be putting up content every day. Avoid becoming complacent with the content that you're putting up; experiment with "lifestyle" images as well as product images. You can measure the performance of your Instagram posts within the Piqora dashboard. Give people an inside look into your brand by giving them sneak peaks at products, show them cool aspects of your office space, and make them feel like they're a part of it all. Chances are, your audience will react positively.


## 4. Run an Instagram Promotion


Instagram promotions are still in their infancy, but running a promotion around a designated hashtag is a great way to acquire new followers. The best way to promote these promotions is by broadcasting it throughout your other social channels and prompting your customers and potential customers to participate via email. Convert those fans and email subscribers to Instagram followers! 

Piqora's technology enables brands to easily create great looking, mobile-optimized landing pages that can live on your website or within a Facebook tab. Now go apply these tips and expand your brand presence on Instagram!

Doing all of these things will put you on a great path to drastically widening your audience on Instagram. While they're all sound practices, you should still experiment with new strategies and techniques. While regularity is important, creativity is paramount.
