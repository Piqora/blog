We're delighted to announce that we've just launched a rich content library dedicated to helping marketing professionals of all stripes get the most out of Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr. Complete with ebooks, guides, whitepapers, case studies, and research reports our **[Resources Center](http://www.piqora.com/resources)** has something for everyone. Whether you are just looking to get started on the Big Three visual networks or take your strategy to the next level, we've got you covered.

We work closely with hundreds of brands such as Sephora, Zappos, and Steve Madden, and we've gained insights from both our extensive experience and massive repository of data.  We think the Visual Web presents an enormous, untapped opportunity for marketers, and with its explosive growth there's never been a better time to share what we've learned.

As Piqora CEO Sharad Verma put it, "While a lot of attention goes to Facebook and Twitter, social marketers are increasingly looking at networks like Pinterest, Instagram and Tumblr to build communities, increase brand awareness, and distribute content that can kick-start the consumer buying process and even accelerate movement through the purchase funnel. B2C marketers need to rethink things as strategies for Facebook and Twitter do not always translate to the interest-based networks.”

Sharad added, “We are sharing the knowledge we’ve gained from working with hundreds of leading brands that have been successful on the Big Three visual networks. Analysis of our massive repository of analytics data has given us great insights into what works and what doesn't.”

[The Resources Center](http://www.piqora.com/resources) today focuses on Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr but will soon also include information on rapidly emerging Visual Networks such as Houzz (Home Decor), Polyvore (Fashion), and WeHeartIt. We're also going to be adding videos, so stay tuned!
