_With this post, the Pinfluencer team is introducing a regular blog category, **[Pinfluencer](http://www.pinfluencer.com) Feature Flash**_.

When a user pins a picture to a Pinterest board, it may be anything from a simple expression of personal taste to an outright endorsement of a product.  Whatever the reason, the action behind a pin has many attributes that could be useful to a brand.  But we believe the most significant is that: **a pin creates the path to a purchase**.<!-- more -->

Brands should think of pins as assets that generate purchases.  Pinfluencer’s Pin-to-Purchase feature treats pins as hyperlinks and tracks the sales funnel by integrating a brand’s Google Analytics with its Pinterest accounts.  **[Coming soon:  Pinfluencer will integrate with Omniture and CoreMetrics as well.**]

More engagement on pins leads to  more clicks to a brand’s website, page views, and eventually, purchases.  By integrating analytics into the metrics mix, brands get actionable and predictive insights into how pin engagement drives different outcomes within the sales funnel.

Pinfluencer also tracks aggregate revenue performance via metrics such as Revenue per Pin.  On a 30 day average, Revenue per pin is $1.2 (according to a recent data sample of retailers using Pinfluencer).  With the economic value of the pin at your fingertips, you can now make a strong case for building a deep Pinterest presence, and you can budget for Pinterest campaigns like  contests.

Pinfluencer’s Pin-to-Purchase magic is very easy to get.  One click connects your brand’s Pinfluencer account with Google Analytics, and a quick authorization within the Pinfluencer account triggers Pinfluencer to pull revenue, purchases, clicks and page view data once a day for every pin.  The result is granular data that brands have never had from their websites, for any social network:  things like, which pin drives the most of revenue or page views, or how does our Revenue per Pin look compared to last week.  Most important, there is transparency around the return on the time a brand has invested in networking on Pinterest.

Brands using [Pinfluencer](http://www.pinfluencer.com) to connect their Pinterest accounts with Google Analytics gain the critical ability to track the sales funnel more specifically.  Knowing the economic performance of pins empowers brand teams to pin strategically – aligning pins with seasons, local and regional needs, and most important, the buyer values within target customer segments.
