Happy Halloween!! We just got back from the [Social Fresh West](http://socialfreshconference.com/) conference in San Diego. The event was packed with amazing speakers covering the latest advances and techniques in the world of social media. If you want to check out the presentation that the Piqora team shared, you can view it [here.](http://prezi.com/oenmmtumktcp/social-fresh/)

Of all the tips, techniques and insights we shared at Social Fresh, by far the most number of questions emerged around our advice that** for optimal engagement, you should add up to seven hashtags to your Instagram posts. **

Hashtags are the key to conversation building and brand discoverability on Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter. They enable brands to participate in broader conversations, gain visibility beyond their followers and grow their community. By correctly leveraging them and adding up to seven hashtags, you can see nearly 25% increases in the number of likes on each of your posts. Just be aware that while you may get away with adding up to eight, there's a huge drop off at nine, as people will start to see that as spam.

## So What Hashtags Should You Use?


Most brands are underutilizing hashtags: nearly 30% of posts have no hashtags, while more than half average one or less. Adding just three can result in huge gains in engagement, but only 10% of brands are doing so, while just 4% are in the optimal range.

From our research, we've learned that the** ideal hashtag mix is: **1 brand name, 1 "owned" hashtag (a hashtag that you make up, that is strongly associated with your brand/message) and between 2-5 "community" hashtags. Community hashtags are those that are relevant to your brand and the post, have broad appeal, and are commonly and widely used. By way of example, if you were Nike, the hashtags on one of your posts might be **#Nike **(your brand) **#JustDoIt **(owned hashtag) **#Running#Fitness#Health#Athlete **(community hashtags).







If you want more information, you can download our [Instagram Hashtag Report](http://go.piqora.com/rs/pinfluencer/images/Dec%202013%20Instagram%20Study%20Piqora.pdf), which incorporates research drawn from more than 200 brands and hundreds of thousands of Instagram posts. But in the meantime, here are a few recommendations to help you get the most out your hashtag strategy. Happy Instagramming!







**1. Think & Act like an Instagram user**


Do your best to make your brand act like a person. Don’t just use your branded hashtag - it can come off as too promotional. Learn which hashtags your target audience is already using (especially influencers!) and add them regularly to your posts so long as they are relevant. When selecting hashtags, think about what users want. Use natural keywords like, and also try spicing it up (i.e instead of #fitness, try #fitnessaddict.)

**2. Choose hashtags that are appropriate for your business vertical**

Contextualizing things based on your business vertical is a great way to figure out which hashtags to use. For example, if  you are an e-commerce brand, consider using color names (i.e. #cutepink), product attributes (i.e. #rustic), or product categories (i.e. #outdoorfurniture). Or, if your brand relates to fitness, consider category hashtags such as #yoga, #crossfit and result-oriented hashtags like #lookgood, #feelstrong etc.

**3. Want to get discovered? Think SEO**

Instead of punching keywords into a search bar, Instagrammers search for hashtags they are interested in. As an Instagram SEO’er, your goal is to add relevant hashtags that your target audience is searching for. Be sure that some have broad appeal and are commonly used: those help you get incremental reach and visibility beyond your profile followers.
