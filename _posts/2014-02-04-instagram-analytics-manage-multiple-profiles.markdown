Reporting [Instagram analytics](https://www.piqora.com/products/instagram) is a painful process for marketing agencies (and brands that have more than one Instagram profile). Instagram's mobile app requires social media managers to log in, check followers, comments, and likes — then log out and repeat for each client's (or sister brand's) profile. 

This process is clunky and wastes time. Not to mention all the potential issues with having a sticky note with 5 brands' Instagram usernames and passwords on your monitor.
