If you want more tips for getting the most out of your upcoming promotions and engaging your fans while they’re excited and anxious to share their Halloween creativity,  check out our full [Marketers Guide to Halloween Promotions on Pinterest and Instagram.](http://go.piqora.com/halloween-marketers-guide.html?ls=blog) This downloadable guide includes:


**Contest Ideas **
















Americans spent $7 billion on Halloween last year, and this year 43% of adults plan to dress up while 50% will decorate their house. The same intense burst of creativity that makes Halloween so incredibly fun also makes it a Pinterest and Instagram marketer’s dream, and the perfect time to run a promotion on these platforms. You don’t necessarily need a direct connection between your brand and Halloween; you just want to be a part of the action and conversation.

For example, you could run a Pinterest promotion in the weeks running up to Halloween on creating your dream costume, and an Instagram photo contest on Halloween night to show off how they turned out! The guide contains tons of ideas that can be adapted to work across many product categories and industry verticals.






































**How to Design Your Promotions to Be Scarily Successful **
















Whether you're trying to gain more followers, increase engagement and amplification, drive website traffic or promote a specific product, you need to prioritize your objectives and engineer your contest accordingly. After you’ve prioritized your objectives, consider if you’d be better served by a promotion on Pinterest or Instagram. Brand marketers looking to drive metrics such as awareness and brand recall should seriously consider experimenting with Instagram, while direct response marketers interested in clicks, sales and conversions can harness the massive potential of Pinterest (for more info on deciding where you should run your contest, check out our post on the [comparative advantages of Pinterest and Instagram](http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-and-instagram-thoughts-from-the-2014-social-media-insider-summit/), or[ this flowchart](http://blog.piqora.com/retail-marketers-should-you-focus-on-pinterest-or-instagram/).) Our Halloween guide contains detailed info on:



	
  * **Establishing and Achieving Contest Goals**

	
  * **Barriers to Entry, and Their Impact on Success**

	
  * **Picking a Prize, and How Prizes Affect Contests**

	
  * **Harnessing #Halloween Hashtags**


That last point is critical. A promotion that harnesses the surge in social traffic around Halloween can be a huge audience booster, as well as a powerful tool for [migrating your audience over from other platforms](http://blog.piqora.com/instagram-marketing-brand-activity-on-instagram-is-closing-in-on-facebook/). #Hashtags are key to building these conversations on Instagram, and making sure your promotions stand out on Halloween and don't fall into the background noise.
