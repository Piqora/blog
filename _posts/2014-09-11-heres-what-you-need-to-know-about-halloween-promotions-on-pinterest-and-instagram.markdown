Happy Halloween!! I know we aren't even halfway through September, but I'm already deep into planning my costume (any suggestions are welcome; I'm currently going back and forth between a [hot air balloon](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/491033165592763428/) or an [AT-AT walker from Star Wars](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/167125836144699247/).) And if I'm already thinking about my costume, it's _definitely_ time to start planning your Halloween promotions on Pinterest or Instagram.

Pinterest and Instagram marketers shouldn't just love Halloween because [Americans spent $7 billion on the holiday last year](http://www.mihidigital.co.uk/blog/halloween-statistics-2013/). They should love it because it's one of the most creative, interactive, whimsical and _fun_ holidays, and with all of this intense activity your fans are excited, engaged and anxious to share their Halloween adventures with the world!













So whether you are a retailer, publisher, travel company or practically any any other type of business, Halloween is a perfect time to run a Pinterest or Instagram promotion and get in on the fun. And to help you get the most out of your upcoming promotions, we've created a brand new  [Marketers Guide to Halloween Promotions on Pinterest and Instagram.](http://go.piqora.com/halloween-marketers-guide.html?ls=blog) Some of the things you'll find in it include:


**Contest Ideas by Network and Vertical**
















You don’t necessarily need a direct connection between your brand and Halloween; you just want to be a part of the action and conversation.  It’s also important to remember that you don’t need to choose between Pinterest or Instagram; you can definitely do both, just be sure your promotions are platform appropriate.

As a party supply company, their catalog makes for outstanding Pinterest content, and they did a great job of capitalizing on Halloween trends and highlighting their brand’s connection to the holiday. They offered a valuable, relevant prize, made it easy and fun to enter, and gave participants multiple opportunities to “Pin&Win.” The result? Nearly 3,000 participants and thousands of Pins!](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Party-City-Promo-Blog.jpg)](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Party-City-Promo-Blog.jpg) Party City’s Hello Halloween promotion perfectly illustrates the power of choosing the right platform and optimizing your contest for it.

For example, you could run a Pinterest promotion in the weeks running up to Halloween on creating your dream costume, and an Instagram photo contest on Halloween night to show off how they turned out! The guide contains tons of ideas that can be adapted to work across many product categories and industry verticals, but here are just a few:













**Halloween Recipe Pin and Win Contest:** A quick Pinterest search for Halloween recipes shows just how popular these are. Since people are already creating, searching for and pinning Halloween recipes, why not create an opportunity for your brand to reward Pinners for something they’re already doing?

























**Costume Contests:** Obviously these make for great Instagram material! There are tons of variations here, for instance a Best Pet Costume contest ([12% of pet owners dress their pets up for Halloween](http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/businessopportunities/a/halloweenopps.htm)) or a contest where entrants have to include one of your products as part of their costume in order to qualify. Be creative, as even if you don’t offer products that are directly related to Halloween you can always tie your brand in somehow; [Flo from Progressive even has her own costume line](http://www.amazon.com/Progressive-Collection-Insurance-Costume-One_Size/dp/B009B14SA2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409082874&sr=8-1&keywords=flo+from+progressive+costume).


**How to Design Your Promotions to Be Scarily Successful **
















Whether you're trying to gain more followers, increase engagement and amplification, drive website traffic or promote a specific product, you need to prioritize your objectives and engineer your contest accordingly. After you’ve prioritized your objectives, consider if you’d be better served by a promotion on Pinterest or Instagram. Brand marketers looking to drive metrics such as awareness and brand recall should seriously consider experimenting with Instagram, while direct response marketers interested in clicks, sales and conversions can harness the massive potential of Pinterest (for more info on deciding where you should run your contest, check out our post on the [comparative advantages of Pinterest and Instagram.](http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-and-instagram-thoughts-from-the-2014-social-media-insider-summit/)) Our Halloween guide contains detailed info on:



	
  * **Establishing and Achieving Contest Goals**

	
  * **Barriers to Entry, and Their Impact on Success**

	
  * **Picking a Prize, and How Prizes Affect Contests**

	
  * **Harnessing #Halloween Hashtags**

	
  * **Why You Should Launch Early and Promote Heavily**


That last point is critical. A promotion that harnesses the surge in social traffic around Halloween can be a huge audience booster, as well as a powerful tool for [migrating your audience over from other platforms](http://blog.piqora.com/instagram-marketing-brand-activity-on-instagram-is-closing-in-on-facebook/), so to maximize exposure, consider launching your promotions well in advance of Halloween, especially on Pinterest. Pinterest contests are terrific for capitalizing on people’s Halloween preparations and planning, and brands such as Party City and Spirit Halloween have launched very successful Halloween campaigns as early as late September.
