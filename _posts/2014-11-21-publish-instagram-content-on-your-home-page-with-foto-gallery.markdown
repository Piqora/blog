Piqora's new [Foto Gallery](http://www.piqora.com/products/instagram/#fotogallery) tool enables you to take the best User Generated Content from Instagram that relates to your brand, moderate it, and publish it on your site to create authentic visual stories, inspire your audience and build meaningful, powerful connections with your brand advocates.

Our research indicates that incorporating UGC on your site can increase time on site by up to 16%. Foto Gallery allows your brand to create fully moderated galleries in a seamless, beautiful way and easily publish them on any web page or Facebook Tab. These galleries are created by showing you all the Instagram content that relates to your branded hashtag, such as Land of Nod's #landofnod, or campaign hashtags on category pages like Williams-Sonoma does with #myopenkitchen.

Deploying Foto Gallery is simple, as the gallery will be completely set up by one of Piqora's Customer Success Managers. All you have to do is choose your favorite photos that are posted with your chosen hashtag!
