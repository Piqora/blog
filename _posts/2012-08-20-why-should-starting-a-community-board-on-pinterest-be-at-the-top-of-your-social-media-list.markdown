As a brand, you can easily use Pinterest to build awareness  and to introduce new products.  What you **_really_** want to do is take it to the next level:  invite your users and fans to become curators of your content on your community board.

Pinterest is the only social network that enables you to invite your users to help you curate your content.  You can’t create this level of interaction on any other network.  It’s a connection over your products that’s deeper than retweeting and liking – because your community is expressing itself through you.<!-- more -->

On the Pinterest network alone, we are seeing 20 percent more followers and 30 percent more engagement on community boards than on product or random boards.  When you give your customers and influencers a specific destination for contributing their perspective, Pinterest becomes even more powerful for your brand.

There’s another big reason to launch a robust community board on Pinterest.

You may not have the people on your social media and marketing teams with the time to curate your Pinterest boards.  Invest some time in creating a community board, and your members will enrich your Pinterest presence for you.  And they will tell you what they find most interesting in your products.

When you invite users to join your community board, you are extending a privilege, and users on Pinterest know it – just as they appreciate an invitation to an in-store event, for example.  The community board gives you the opportunity to show your users they are valued and honored – and that you believe they can curate your content for you.

One of our goals at Pinfluencer is to help brands get closer to their fans.  That’s why **we help our customers build community boards that are a great experience for their users**.

Pinfluencer helps you figure out whom to invite.  It helps you track the influential pinners who have visited your website and we identify the most influential pinners in every category relevant to your brand.  You can follow these pinners directly from the Pinfluencer dashboard and then go to Pinterest to invite them.  These influential pinner recommendations help you get the maximum out of your invitations.

Let us know how we can help you launch your community board by writing to us at team@pinfluencer.com.
