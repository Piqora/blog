Having a well thought out profile on Pinterest can the be difference between your brand getting millions or repins (like BHG) or none whatsoever. Brands have many goals for starting a rich visual profile presence on Pinterest such as telling a visual story, driving engagement around brand's visual content and inspiring their community on pinterest.

The next step is to scale your audience on Pinterest and by far the best way to do that to use and reuse your best content. However on Pinterest -- its not just about visual content or images. It is also about how you organize your pins, what themes your boards have, what stories do they tell. Users on Pinterest are more likely to follow a board than follow a brand. This is because Pinterest is a true interest based network where users engage in surgical pursuit of topics. Also following boards is more emphasized in Pinterest's new UI.

There are several ways to organize your pins into a board. Boards can be very broad, for e.g. "For your Home" to very specific "Wicker Baskets for the Spring". Broad board themes offer larger coverage and cater to many interests and attract higher # of followers and overall engagement. Specific board themes on the other hand, naturally attract select pinners who are really invested into that topic and also might just have ephemeral interest. So from a social engagement standpoint, broad board themes or not-too-specific board themes are your best bet.

So why would you want to create very specific boards? The answer is simple. Google SEO. Specific boards get more traffic from google than broad themed boards. Let's see why.

Users on search are generally lower down in the purchase funnel are "looking" for something. Unlike Pinterest which is driven by discovery and inspiration, search is about information gathering, research, comparison shopping and pursuit of something "specific". 70% of the keyword searches are long tail i.e. longer than 3 words. 36% of the shoppers research the product before querying for the brand they want to buy the product from. It is well known in the SEO industry, that content created for long tail keywords is the way to drive more traffic from Google.

Specific boards are your content for Google long tail keywords and your silver bullet to drive SEO. For e.g. "Rustic Coffee Tables", "Accessories for Vintage Coffee Tables", "Affordable Wicker Outdoor Furniture". Use your Google Analytics report to know the long tail keywords that are driving traffic to your website today. Think of your Pinterest board as a landing page for your long tail searches. Make sure to use the target keywords in your pin descriptions and board title. Those keywords help google index and rank your Pinterest boards.
