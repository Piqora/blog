Pinterest is the first top-of-the-funnel social network that is fundamentally about idea and product discovery. It is the new social e-commerce central that is connecting people to their aspirations. In this post we'll outline some of the recent trends that clearly establish the bright future awaiting Pinterest and social e-commerce. Bear in mind that Pinterest just raised a massive $225M Series E, with a valuation of $3.8B – with the that huge cash infusion there will substantial investment in the platform, and the following statistics will likely only become more impressive.



	
  * **Steady User Growth**: Pinterest grew from 35 million users in mid 2011 to 70 million users by early 2013. That's a 100% growth in 18 months. According to comscore, Pinterest got 53.3 million unique visitors in March 2013 - roughly double its traffic a year earlier.

	
  * **Rising share of Social E-commerce**: Pinterest share of social e-commerce sales grew from 2% a year ago to 23% in Q2, 2013. That is nearly one fourth of all social e-commerce. Read more [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-and-pinterest-in-social-commerce-2013-9#ixzz2dxR2j5U8).

	
  * **Revenue per Pin in Dec 2012 was $0.64**. On average a retailer generated 64 cents in sales for every pin that originated from their profile or website. Pinterest receives 100M+ new pins every day. At 64 cents a pin - Pinterest is generating billions of dollars worth of e-commerce sales per month.

	
  * **New online showroom**: 41% of pinners engage in reverse show-rooming. Those pinners discover the product on Pinterest but end up purchasing those products in the brick-and-mortar stores. 59% of the pinners buy the product 2 weeks after pinning the product.

According to Monetate, Pinners spend $80.54 per order when coming from Pinterest, compared with $71.26 for Facebook and $70.17 for Twitter.

  * **50% of all social sharing on iPad happens via Pinterest**. Read more on our [pinterest blog](http://blog.piqora.com/pinterest-share-of-social-commerce-traffic-continues-to-accelerate/).

	
  * **Pinners are 10% more likely to buy products** according to [Shopify's study](http://pinterest.com/IKEAUK/pin-it-to-win-it/) on its network. It also suggests pins with labelled prices receive 36% more likes than the average pin.


Activity on Pinterest reveals intent. Majority of the users are women between 24-44, a group that controls majority of consumer purchasing decisions. And the network is growing internationally. To ignore Pinterest is like ignoring a large scale automated focus group that is telling your brand what they like and worse it is overlooking a huge and growing revenue opportunity. Pinterest does not have ads yet; but to wait for ads would be like forgoing SEO while waiting for Google Adwords.
