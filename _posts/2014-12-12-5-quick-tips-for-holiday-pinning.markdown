Happy Holidays! 'Tis the season for shopping, gifting, cooking and decorating which means.. a lot of people are looking to Pinterest for inspiration. It's time to step up your pinning strategy (and frequency) to keep your brand at the forefront of this festive frenzy. Here are 5 quick tips to get you started:



	
  1. **Create Holiday Boards**



	
  * Don't underestimate the importance of board titles! Use holiday-themed keywords to help increase visibility in search results.

	
  * Holiday board theme ideas: while it is tempting to push out mass amounts of product pins (it is shopping season, after all) remember that Pinterest is more than an e-commerce platform; it is a place for your brand to connect with your audience and inspire them.

	
    * “Product” Pin Themes: Gift Lists (for him/ for her), Top Gifts, Unique Gifts, etc.

	
    * “Sentiment” Pin Themes: The holiday season is all about wonder and tradition. Hit on themes like family, sharing, cooking, crafting & decorating, cozy-ness, etc.

Already have holiday boards? Be sure to feature "in season" boards by dragging them to the top/ left portion of your Pinterest profile. Switch up the cover photo and add some new pins to make your old holiday boards seem fresher than a newly cut pine tree.

  2. ** Use High-Traffic Keywords**



	
  * Much like board titles, pin descriptions are incredibly important for maximizing exposure.

	
  * Think of how people will be searching Pinterest; include high traffic words (holiday, gifts, etc.) as well as terms that describe your product.

  3. ** Add Holiday Products to Current Boards**



	
  * Identify some top performing boards and add seasonal products to them to leverage your existing audience.

	
  * Don’t be afraid to double pin! A holiday pin can be posted to both a holiday board and a different, relevant board (ex: a holiday sweater can be pinned to “Holiday Wish List” as well as “Cozy Sweaters”).

  4. ** Increase Pinning Activity**



	
  * People are spending more time on Pinterest during the holidays; scale your pinning activity accordingly.

	
  * With Piqora’s Smart Scheduler, you can schedule up to 100 pins per day!

  5. **Leverage Rich Pins**



	
  * [Product Pins](https://business.pinterest.com/en/rich-pins) stand out with extra details like price and availability (which are automatically inserted) in addition to your pin descriptions.

	
  * Product pins will also show up in the Pinterest Gifts category!
