The whole Piqora team is extremely excited to announce our participation in the [Pinterest Business Insights API program](http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/20/pinterest-rolls-out-a-new-business-insights-api-to-select-marketing-technology-companies/). Piqora is one of only a [handful of companies invited by Pinterest](http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/pinterest-marketers-are-about-get-data-they-want-157874) to participate in this program. Using Pinterest's API as the basis for our 50+ reports, metrics, and integration with Google Analytics/Omniture/Coremetrics (to track top pins by clicks and revenue) puts everything on solid footing.

Additionally, we're announcing the launch of the first product built on top Pinterest's API:  **"Pinterest Trends,"** which allows marketers to gather deep industry and category-level insights that benchmark a brand’s performance on Pinterest against the performance of their competitors. Many of our customers have asked for help understanding their category better and learning what types of content pinners like. Now marketers can define and group brands, track popular content, and benchmark their metrics.

Pinterest Trends offers category, competitive, and group-based benchmarking. Our Pinterest Trends dashboard allows a marketer to create groups of brands across verticals to benchmark virality, community growth, engagement and more. The ability to group brands enables Piqora customers to craft well-informed content strategies and make data-driven publishing decisions across the visual web.

With access to data from Pinterest's API, our customers can expect more reports and segmented analytics in future. Our vision is to be the most actionable visual marketing dashboard and help marketers scale their presence on visual channels.

Stay tuned!
