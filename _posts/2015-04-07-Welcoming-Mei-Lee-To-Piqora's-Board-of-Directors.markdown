<span>E</span>veryone here at Piqora spends a lot of time thinking about visual content 
marketing, so when we got an opportunity to have Mei Lee, who was most recently Vice President of Marketing at Conde Nast, 
to join a brainstorming call a few months ago, we obviously jumped at the chance.

The focus of the call was how Piqora can do an even better job of helping brands accelerate ROI from their visual marketing efforts, 
and Mei’s extensive experience leading digital marketing teams really showed in the depth of her insights.

Since then, Mei has officially joined Piqora’s board of advisors to help brands generate business results from socially validated 
photos across digital channels and engage with their audience emotionally, visually and authentically.

Mei had this to say about her decision to join us, “Many of the best brands looking to capitalize on the rising role of visual marketing 
are already working with Piqora. Visual marketing is more than beautiful imagery to me - it is storytelling. I’m most excited about seeing 
brands gain favorability and awareness by unleashing the power of this art form and finding marketing ROI in visual storytelling.”

We’ve been working incredibly hard over the past few months to bring our latest UGC marketing platform to life, so brands can start harvesting, 
publishing, and generating results from photos created by their audiences.

This is another area where Mei’s experience will really add value to Piqora’s customers. In her own words, “I’m so excited to join the Board of Advisors 
of one of the leading visual marketing technology companies in the social media space. I couldn’t imagine a more innovative, relevant and authentic organization 
to be a part of and I look forward to contributing to the next phase of the company’s growth.”

We’re excited too. Excited about Mei joining Piqora, and excited about helping marketers leverage customer photos to drive commerce, engagement and advertising results.

Welcome to the team Mei!
