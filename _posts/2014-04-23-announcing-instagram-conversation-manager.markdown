Instagram is a visual, emotional social network that consumers love. The problem with Instagram, from a social media manager's perspective, is that monitoring comments and @mentions means hopping around from one photo to next. For brands with multiple profiles it means logging in and out of the app on your phone. But not any more.


## A Tweetdeck for Instagram


Piqora has just launched **Instagram Conversation Manager**, to enable marketers to easily monitor and respond to user comments and brand @mentions. Just like Tweetdeck, Instagram Conversation Manager aggregates all the comments and @mentions in multiple columns that auto-update allowing social marketers to monitor and participate in conversations from their desktop, which hopefully has a full-size keyboard if not a nice big monitor and comfy chair.


## What Instagram Conversation Manager Does


Instagram is a photo sharing network and Piqora's image-based-conversation interface makes it easy to reply (and track responses to those replies). Before today there was no way for social marketers to keep track of which comments they have responded to and track post-response conversation threads or see historical comments beyond 50 on Instagram. Instagram Conversation Manager shows you all the comments including historical comments from your profile.

**Here's the specifics on what Instagram Conversation Manager enables you to do:**

1. See all comments and @mentions from multiple profiles
2. Add or delete profiles for monitoring
3. Respond to comments or @mentions
4. A separate feed for conversations already participated in
5. All responses are posted to Instagram in real-time
6. All historical comments and @mentions are pre-populated, so you can start responding right away.

Instagram is just going to keep growing, and for brands managing communities of 10,000 people or more, it's just not sustainable to do that from a mobile device with limited options. Instagram Conversation Manager is the tool was built for social media teams to get to 1,000,000 followers.
