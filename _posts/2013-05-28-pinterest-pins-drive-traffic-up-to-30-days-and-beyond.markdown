Piqora recently studied the traffic generation potential of pins as they age. In other words we looked at the half life of a pin as well as the long tail age of a pin.

What we found was:



	
  1. 40% of the clicks happen within the first day.

	
  2. 70% of the clicks happen within first 2 days.

	
  3. Remaining 30% clicks come all the way through 30 days and beyond

Content on networks like facebook and twitter is very ephemeral. Users glance at the feed and bounce when the feed reaches posts that they have seen before. Facebook can be a very in and out experience for a lot of users.

Pinterest is on the other hand is a network where users are searching for inspiration. It's a task driven network. Users are looking for ideas, curating their boards, expressing taste and looking for ways to improve their life. That makes Pinterest as much as navigation and search driven network as it is a social feed driven network.Â This search and navigation behavior on Pinterest leads to old pins showing up in search results and driving traffic to your site.

Users coming from old pins are just as important as users clicking through on new pins and you need to make sure that if the old pins are out of stock or point to 404 pages, you create compelling landing experiences to better retain your old pin traffic. Piqora recently built a product called Gallery is designed just for that. Email us at hello@piqora.com to get a demo.
