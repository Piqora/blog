Forget about the fast cars, exotic travel and gadgets: being [James Bond is hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoQwKe0lggw), and not only because every now and then a villain will try and blast him with a laser beam or [try and bite him to death on a train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CogCFACcNPc). Even regular day-to-day shopping is rough on the guy; as an international man of mystery, he can't exactly pop down to the local mall, so Mr. Bond has to rely on Q for everything he needs. Consequently, even getting a new stereo [is an exercise in terror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLU8cf3H7J0).

Fortunately, things have come a long way since 1962. Today, Bond doesn't have to go to a dingy underground bunker below MI6 to pick out an outfit, he can just pull out his phone.


## And to help James and his favorite brands out, we've created: [The Ultimate Guide to Pinterest & Instagram Marketing for Luxury Brands.](http://go.piqora.com/luxury-pinterest.html)


Judging by his tastes, Mr. Bond probably draws a lot inspiration for what to buy from browsing Instagram, which is the [dominant network for luxury goods](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/219206/for-luxury-brands-instagram-blows-pinterest-away.html). At the very least, [he found his watch there](http://instagram.com/p/tDr0Hawb7m/?modal=true). James switched from Rolex watches to Omega in 1995, and while we won't go so far as to claim that's solely because [Omega has a fantastic Instagram profile](http://instagram.com/omega) with more than 85,000 followers, it certainly didn't hurt (Rolex doesn't even have an official account.)

[caption id="attachment_1744" align="aligncenter" width="600"][![Omega is a fantastic example of a company engaging with their top brand influencers.

James also [recently started wearing Tom Ford](http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2012-10/03/james-bonds-evening-tuxedo-by-tom-ford-for-skyfall-in-selfridges) tuxedos, where he also gets his [custom made cufflinks](http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/tom-ford-orbis-non-sufficit-cufflinks). He probably switched over since his previous tailor, [Brioni](http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/brioni-suits), has neither an Instagram or Pinterest profile, while Tom Ford is [thriving](http://instagram.com/tomford) on [visual networks.](http://www.pinterest.com/tomford/)

This isn't to say that James Bond isn't an avid Pinterest user, because he totally is.  Needing something to carry all his schwag, he popped over to Gucci, [one of the top luxury brands on Instagram](http://list.totems.co/tag/luxury-brands/af34bd7f4e8916330fb7e595929a404ee3ceaf74). But [unlike most luxury brands](http://fashionista.com/2014/03/why-some-luxury-brands-still-dont-sell-online) Gucci sells their products online, so maybe he went to [Gucci's Pinterest profile,](http://www.pinterest.com/gucci/) where he found a [suitcase](http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/gucci-suitcase) and [belt](http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/gucci-belt) for his _Man With the Golden Gun _mission.

[caption id="attachment_1746" align="aligncenter" width="600"][![Gucci’s top performing content on Pinterest is generally product shots, but they showcase their products in beautiful and creative ways, perfect for attracting fashionistas and spies alike](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gucci-Pinterest-Bond-Blog.jpg)](http://blog.piqora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gucci-Pinterest-Bond-Blog.jpg) Gucci’s top performing content on Pinterest is generally product shots, but they showcase their products in beautiful and creative ways, perfect for attracting fashionistas and spies alike[/caption]

While we're not sure whether he found his Gucci gear on that company's Pinterest or Instagram profile, but one thing is certain: [James Bond shops for cars on Pinterest.](http://www.pinterest.com/astonmartin/)

[Aston Martin](http://www.pinterest.com/astonmartin/) apparently has a "License to Kill It" on Pinterest. With nearly 200,000 followers (far more than they have[ on Instagram](http://instagram.com/astonmartinlagonda)), they're the top luxury car marque on platform by a long shot. They have boards for each of their current line of cars, as well as legacy models such as [Bond's first ride, the legendary DB5.](http://www.pinterest.com/astonmartin/aston-martin-db5/) In fact, James is such an active Pinner that Aston Martin identified him early on as one of their key brand advocates, and created a board specifically to [showcase their longstanding relationship](http://www.pinterest.com/astonmartin/aston-martin-james-bond/).

James Bond might be the ultimate luxury consumer, but like many people in his demographic, he's busy leading a life chock full of [speed boats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN8avpXNASA), [partying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V31rpJXbse4), [private jets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlBUPtKIoHo), [exotic sports cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzqGrJNCtZ4), [skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVBPoGcuLK4), and of course [personal submarines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeBqf6bYZak). He doesn't have time to stop by a store anytime he needs to buy something; he's [always on the go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K8zz9eI4-8). This makes Instagram and Pinterest the perfect platforms for luxury brands to engage with Mr. Bond and people like him; after all, Pinterest users are [predominantly young, wealthy people who spend a lot of money on the platform](http://www.businessinsider.com/pinterest-is-worth-2-billion-because-its-25-million-users-are-rich-female-and-like-to-spend-2013-2), and nearly [30 percent of them make more than $100,000 a year](http://www.luxurydaily.com/luxury-brands-need-a-search-and-social-strategy-for-pinterest/).

Pinterest and Instagram are inspirational and aspirational by nature and design, making them a perfect fit for brands whose products are [beautiful, desirable, and exclusive](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/34480753371871661/).These facts aren't lost on high-end brands; a recent study revealed that [93% of them are active on Instagram.](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/219206/for-luxury-brands-instagram-blows-pinterest-away.html) Marketers looking to maximize the awesome potential of these networks should definitely **[download our new guide](http://go.piqora.com/luxury-pinterest.html), **which is packed with insights, tips and techniques from top luxury brands. The guide was created to help luxury marketers capture their brands' distinct, exclusive ‘feel’ and culture to create a rich experience for audiences on Pinterest and Instagram, and covers everything from content strategy and harnessing hashtags to and setting and achieving goals that will really move the needle forward.  If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to me, my name is Osborn.
