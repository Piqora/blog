Feeds on social networks move very fast. Pinterest is no exception and given how easy it is to repin, feeds move even faster. This means knowing when to pin is almost as important as what to pin.

If you are not pinning when your followers are most engaged, your pins are invisible. Gradually, that results in your followers losing touch with your brand. The half life of pin in most cases is less than 6 hours -- which means most pins don't get any visibility after 6 hours.

Let's say you pin at 11 AM and most of your followers log into pinterest early in the morning at around 7 AM or around 4 PM, your pins are invisible and its a wasted effort. **Pinfluencer just launched time engagement tracking for your followers -- for both weekdays and weekends.**

In the followers and pinners section of your metrics tab, you could see the _exact time when your followers are most engaged_. You can click through details and see how this engagement varies through out the day. This graph will help you decide the most optimal time to pin your content on your boards. If you pin on weekends, this is an invaluable tool to help you make most of your weekend work.


The graph above indicates that about the peak time on weekends are around 10 AM and the peak time on weekdays is around 10 PM. Pinfluencer defines follower engagement as the time during which your followers are active on pinterest - via pinning or repinning.




### ****Try our [pinterest analytics](http://www.pinfluencer.com) and pin when your followers are most active. **Happy Pinning!**
