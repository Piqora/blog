Internet is seeing the first wave of maturing image and interest based social networks. Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, Polyvore, Houzz, and Wanelo. The web of 1995 was a replication of magazine _pages_ online. The web of 2013 is information appearing on dynamic, personalized, visual streams of social networks, consumed on ubiquitous devices.

These interest based networks are about taste, intent, personalized content discovery and exhibit following similar characteristics:



	
  1. They are public -- which means anyone call follow anyone and subscribe to their taste.

	
  2. Content consumption is happening on the self-selected visual feeds that are populated via curation activity of followers

	
  3. Actions on the content create virality and amplification. For e.g. Re-pinning and Re-blogging - are the primary ways in which the content spreads through Pinterest and Tumblr

	
  4. Granular interest based followership of boards offered by networks like Pinterest.

	
  5. Collections as the primary way for users to express and curate. Pinterest boards, Ideabooks of Houzz and Sets on Polyvore.


And this is just the beginning. Mobile devices and cameras are unleashing even more creativity and content creation. SnapGuide let's users build step by step guides. Vine from twitter allows users to create short videos. Creativity, collection, curation is now available to anyone with an idea and a mobile device .

Today's consumer is collecting and curating image based content, self-selecting people they want to follow and consume from.Â This opens up vast opportunities for marketers to comprehensively understand their audience and interact with them at much more granular and relevant level.
