Publishing a large volume of social content is a common challenge faced by social media teams. Signing in and out of multiple apps, juggling between web and mobile interfaces and staying on top of a cohesive content publishing calendar can be difficult, and that’s exactly why Piqora’s Smart Scheduler was invented; to allow marketers to organize, share and publish content easily to Instagram.

Our Instagram Scheduler makes visual storytelling and content marketing much easier. Rather than logging into Instagram every time you want to post a photo, Instagram Scheduler

allows social teams to plan and schedule their content for the coming weeks all at once. You simply upload your content into your Library, and select which images you’d like to schedule for publishing.

When it’s time to push that content live, you receive an app reminder, allowing you to publish content with just a swipe. All of this means saved time and spared headaches for social media managers and their teams.

Once you’ve selected your images for publishing, it will be displayed in an integrated team calendar, so everyone knows exactly what’s being published at all times. You can change scheduling from your phone, reorder photos, and easily add more content to your library; just drag and drop files or folders from your desktop, or use Piqora’s smart bookmarklet that automatically grabs the largest images and includes the product page URL when available.

A winning visual content marketing strategy depends on publishing great content, often, and at the right time. Piqora’s visual content schedulers enable you to schedule and upload a volume of content, track your content calendar at a glance, and scale your publishing efforts for maximum impact.
