Since January, when fitness model and Instagram star Jen Selter was profiled by the [New York Post](http://nypost.com/2014/01/02/instagram-star-jen-selter/), she’s passed 2.2 million followers on Instagram and the average number of likes on her photos has gone up 69% to an average of 140,540 in February. Other articles since then have called Selter, “The net’s best butt,” and “Instagram’s most famous butt.”

So we decided to take an analytical look at how a few hundred selfies launched a career that now includes sponsorships for a water brand, a gym equipment brand, and as a model for [Shape magazine](http://go.piqora.com/ShapeVSXCaseStudyLP.html).


## How Jen Selter Uses Hashtags


To date, Selter has posted 365 times on Instagram, beginning with a single post in March 2012. She wasn’t very active on the social network at the time, and only posted 4 more times in 2012. The first hashtags she used were, #yum and #foodporn in a post from November 2012.

It wasn't until October 2013 that she tagged a post with the hashtag #Seltering. That hashtag has become her most frequently used, and is now being tagged on about 40 Instagram posts a day, that collectively receive over 21K impression, 4,400 likes, and 200 comments. If this from-the-back selfie photo style becomes part of the mainstream fitness zeitgeist, then you can expect those numbers to rise significantly.

While her Instagram account can be considered wildly successful by any metric, Selter could have grown her community of followers even faster if she used some of the Instagram hashtag best practices from our [Instagram Hashtag Report](http://go.piqora.com/Dec2013InstagramStudyLP.html), including using the magic number of 7 hashtags per post.


## How Often She Posts


According to the data we collected, in wasn’t until April 2013 that Selter began her regular posting cadence of ~1 photo per day. This is significantly less than other celebrities on Instagram, like Kim Kardashian for example, who often goes on 5 post-per-day Instagram bursts.

It's also worth noting that Selter has only posted 14 Instagram videos, or about 4% of her total posts.

This posting frequency and photo/video ratio have worked for her as an individual, but fitness and beauty brands looking for insight from Selter's success may want to experiment with more frequent posting, and more videos to engage their communities. Just make sure to have an [Instagram analytics tool](https://www.piqora.com/products/instagram#request_demo) to help evaluate the success of the experiment.

The final takeaway from this analysis for brands that want to grow their Instagram community should come from one of Jen's own posts:
