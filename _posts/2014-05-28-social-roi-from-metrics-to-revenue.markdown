## Social Media Marketing vs. Everything Else


The fundamental thing that makes social networks different from other online media destinations is that social networks have the power to amplify your brand’s content. Traditional online media is a dead-end. It’s unshareable. It can be very targeted and drive direct response behavior but it doesn’t cry out. It doesn't say, “share me”. Social networks on the other hand – if you've built the right community – can amplify your brand’s content and multiply it several times. Think several copies of your brand’s message spreading organically through people. It’s word of mouth and it comes packed with trust. That type of content amplification only happens on social networks.

Which is why measuring amplification is the one of the most important things in social.


<blockquote>Amplification is simply – how fast your content spreads and the number of unique people it reaches. For example if you posted a pin on your Pinterest pin board – how many pinners did it potentially reach in a given period of time? Not only do you want your content to reach as many users as possible but you also want that to happen in a short period of time. The longer it is from the time you posted, the less relevant it might be.</blockquote>



**Actual Reach** is the number of user feeds your content actually appeared in. Only social networks have this data.

**Potential Reach** is the number of user feeds your content could have appeared in. For example if your pin got 100 repins, it could have potentially reached 100 user feeds. The reason why it’s called potential reach is that those 100 users may not be all unique, they may never see your content if they login days after your content was posted, or they're not really active users.

Despite the limitations, Potential Reach is still one of the best measures of virality and content amplification on social networks.


## A Real Community Is A Thing of Beauty


We always tell our customers that the first thing they should do is define what they want to achieve from a given social network. Usually we hear, increase our followers, grow reach, more impressions, traffic, and revenue. But those are metrics, not goals. Goals describe how you want a particular social network to drive value for your brand. It starts with saying something like, "We want to build an engaging community of fans who love our brand," or "We’d like to convert our followers into avid online advocates." 

Social networks are the only online places where brands can build a real community and not just buy paid campaigns. Communities on interest-based networks (Like Pinterest) are made up of people connected through your brand’s products. Your brand can bring people together and be the center stage of conversation and sharing. It's beautiful to watch a brand's community grow and become a connector of people.


## Community Is Not A Vanity Metric


While follower growth and engagement are good metrics to start with, what you really want to know is how fast your community and network influence is growing. It’s about acceleration and velocity not just linear growth. Did you gain 300 new followers this week as compared to 800 followers last month? Did you gain more influential followers? Did you gain followers who take action on your content and spread it?

1.	**Follower Growth Rate**: how many followers are you gaining week over week, month over month?

2.	**Amplification Growth Rate**: how many viral actions (repins, retweets) per post are you getting month over month?

3.	**Engagement Growth Rate**: How many follower actions (likes, comments) per post are you getting month over month?

4.	**Follower Cohort Actions**: How many actions did you get from the group of followers you gained in a particular month? Are your old followers gradually getting disengaged?

5.	**Top 100 Followers**: Always know and actively maintain a list of top 100 fans and cater to them individually and personally. It’s likely that that top 1% drives all your results.

This is arguably more metrics than you need. You don’t have to track every metric. Metrics are only as good as the actions they drive. Drop the metrics that you can’t act on.

As a final word about engagement: Remember not to confuse engagement and amplification. Engagement is actions such as like, comments – which don’t necessarily amplify your content. Amplification actions are repins, retweets, reblogs – actions that amplify your content.


## Matching Metric types To funnel stages


Some metrics are direct and some I like to call, "correlational." Direct metrics are things like potential reach and impressions. Correlational metrics are things like influence, engagement, and number of followers. Generally speaking if your correlational metrics are headed in the right direction, so will your direct metrics. The reason why you should care about correlational metrics is that you can directly impact them. Your strategy on a social network can result in a higher number of engaged and influential followers -- which eventually will drive reach and impressions.

Secondly think about your sales funnel and the customer experience journey. At the very top of the funnel you need more followers. Mid-funnel you need engaged followers. The bottom of the funnel needs content amplification. All stages are important. One influential follower who engages with your content daily and shares it won’t do much for your brand. An army of disengaged followers isn't better. You need to think about feeding all stages of the funnel. Think about acquiring and nurturing content amplifiers, followers who repin, reblog, and retweet.

Interestingly, you can strongly influence amplification at the bottom of your funnel by designing your website for sharing. Websites designed for sharing feed the viral loop and you can increase your traffic without increasing your number of followers.

## If You Click Away And Remember Only One Thing, This Is It


A metric is only as good as the decisions it drives. Metrics should be easily understood and agreed on by different teams. Also a metric without a goal is useless. **Metrics and goals combined are the yardstick you need to be experimenting and executing in a way that drives results.**

Metrics are not a substitute for action. Metrics guide your actions in the right direction but without action they are fruitless. There is always a reason to do something and always a reason not to. Don’t paralyze yourself. Use metrics in the right way and all glory will be yours.
