Like with other social networks, when you think of marketing your brand on Pinterest, SEO is probably not the first thing that comes to mind – and it shouldn't be. Marketers leveraging social networks should work on engaging directly with consumers rather than waiting to be found in Search.

Earlier this year Pinterest eliminated unique URLs for images, primarily in order to avoid spam, and for now Pinterest pages typically do not rank well in a navigational search for a brand name. For most navigational searches, Pinterest still can’t compete with the likes of Facebook, twitter and Google+.<!-- more -->

Sounds like SEO’ing Pinterest is a lost cause? Not so fast. Pin Boards are standalone web pages, and with their unique URLs, page titles, board titles, and board descriptions, Boards provide just about everything in an SEOer’s wish list. Google and other search engines such as Bing crawl and index everything on a Pin Board, so get with your keyword strategist and rewrite your board titles and/or descriptions, or create new Boards. Need help figuring out your keyword strategy for Pinterest? Pinfluencer is working on combining your search and social activity and providing insights around that.

Right now long tail keyword searches are increasingly bringing up both Pin Boards and individual Pins. Although long tail key phrase searches are typically low volume, they can have higher conversion rates than shorter key phrases, so they are worth going after. The board below is optimized for searches such as “Honda Pilot Los Angeles CA”.

Integrate your metadata, but as with any SEO copywriting, write for your visitor and not for the search engines.

Individual Pins on this board also carry necessary metadata and could show up in a similar image search; and with consumers increasingly searching for images this is another opportunity not to be missed. Don't forget those hashtags – they both serve as metadata and make it easier for Pinterest users to find your images.
