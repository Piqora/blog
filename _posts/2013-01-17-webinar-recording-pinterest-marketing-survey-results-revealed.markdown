On Tuesday January 15th, we hosted a webinar to announce the results of our industry survey about Pinterest Marketing. We received responses from ~200 marketers from brands ranging across a broad scope of industries and verticals (watch the webinar to learn who). On the webinar, our Head of Customer Success, Alex Littlewood, revealed results such as:








	
  * All ~200 brands are seeing growth in traffic from Pinterest ranging from steady to massive growth.

	
  * The frequency a brand Pins correlates to increasing web traffic, and the law of diminishing returns applies.

	
  * Promotions are key to driving results in Pinterest.
