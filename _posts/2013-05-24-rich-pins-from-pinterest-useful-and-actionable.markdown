Pinterest made its pins a lot more info rich, imparting those static images some more actionable context. The feature is called “Rich Pins” (or "useful pins" for the end users) and these pinned images now can contain a host of more information right from the originating image site, such as product price and in-stock availability or ingredient listings for recipes.

Pinterest crawlers pull this structured data in real-time from your open schema tags on your web page. You can read more about how to get product price and inventory on your pins at http://business.pinterest.com/rich-pins/. Once you have added the meta-tags, make sure that correct price and in-stock status is appearing on the pins by testing on the [validator](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/).

If you have pins that have been previously pinned to Pinterest, those images can be converted to rich pins retroactively once you have included the meta tag information on the originating pages.

Rich pins have a strong call to action on where to buy the pin in the form of "See this on REI". This can drive more qualified and higher purchase intent traffic to your site while reducing the bounce rate. You can monitor how rich pins impact your traffic volume and the ROI  from Pinterest  on your Piqora dashboard.

At Piqora we believe that Pinterest is the new e-commerce central and rich pins are certainly a strong step in adding more purchasers in the social e-commerce funnel.
