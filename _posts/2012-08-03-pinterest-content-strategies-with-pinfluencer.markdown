As a brand starts out its presence on Pinterest, there are 3 key questions that need to be answered --



	
  1. What themes a.k.a [Pinterest boards](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/ab-test-on-pinterest-with-pinfluencer/) to create to express the voice of the brand and reflect its soul?

	
  2. What content to be pinned on the boards - lifestyle, product etc?

	
  3. What type of community to build - which demographics/category to follow, who should be following the brand etc.?

These are not easy questions and that's why social media agencies pay a lot of attention to crafting the right strategy for their brand clients. There are 2 primary ways Pinfluencer addresses these on-boarding questions -


## 1. Content Strategy via Competitive Insights


On Pinfluencer a brand can track unlimited number of other brands and competitors.Â For each competitor/brand, Pinfluencer provides deep/granular insights into their popular pins, popular boards, and [most engaged and influential pinners](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/pinfluencer-tells-you-when-your-pinterest-followers-are-most-engaged/). These reports make it easy to discover popular content and themes on Pinterest. You know what your competitors are thinking, how are they organizing their boards. Having the most popular pins and boards in a brand's category solves the cold start problem.

It is extremely easy for a brand to track any other competitor, brands they want to emulate, partner brands they like to repin from and brands in adjacent categories.

## 2. Content Strategy by Popular categories

Pinfluencer tracks the most popular pinners and their pins in different categories. An fitness brand can simply choose "health and fitness" category and see the list of most popular users in fitness, check out their popular pins and boards and see what fitness themes are trending on Pinterest. This makes it really easy to design content strategy for a particular category.
