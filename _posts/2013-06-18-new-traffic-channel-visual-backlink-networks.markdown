Let's take a step back and examine the internet. What makes internet so powerful, so navigable? Why are pageviews so much bigger than visits? How are users jumping from page to page? The answer is: Hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are the backbone of internet and the very first vehicle of content discovery.

Now humans are visual creatures and internet pipes have fattened to stream zigabytes of data making the web a very Visual place. First phase of this visualization of the web was _content_ where text content is being replaced with more and more images. The second phase of visualization is happening on _hyperlinks_ - where text hyperlinks are becoming visual.

Visual hyperlinks are meaningful. They are about a product, a thing, an object, a piece of content. Looking at text links that drive traffic to your website on Google Analytics only reveals which traffic sources are the best. Visual hyperlinks that drive traffic to your website, on the other hand, tell a story. They tell a story of what content do people like to click on, what images makes people curious, what images are inspirational to users.

Where do these visual hyperlinks originate from? Just as Google Crawlers crawl text links to discover pages on the internet, human collectors and curators browse through your website and curate images on sites like pinterest, tumblr, polyvore, wanelo etc. This creates a repository of visual backlinks for your website on these networks.

Your traffic and interest in your brand's content is directly proportional to the volume of these visual backlinks a.ka. pins. Find an analytics tool (like Piqora) to first understand which visual backlinks are being created, which are going viral and then invest time and resources to boost the volume of visual backlinks.

In addition to being traffic drivers, Visual networks are also a data driven, automated focus group at scale yielding quick and reliable insights around which content and selections are trending -- acting as more reliable and real-time alternatives to human panels and research. The data from these networks can also inform which images or concepts to use in display advertising creatives, which keywords to bid for in search, and which images to promote on the website, homepage and email.
