Web is changing. It isn't just a collection of text and links. It is gradually becoming hyper-visual turning into a web of things and objects. Because images are easy to produce, consume, share and collect, images are becoming vehicles by which consumers express taste and seek interest based communities. **Taste is Intent**. Pinterest is the first image and interest based social network which has made collection and intent expression extremely easy. These networks are pixelating the web.

Pixel Web = Image and Interest based social networks (for e.g. Pinterest) + Image and Photo feeds on websites (for e.g. Fab).

Because Pixel Web increases propensity to share and collect, it is breeding a new tribe of highly engaged brand advocates and influential users. Pixel web democratizes influence. Users don't have to be celebrities to cast influence. They just have to have taste. Taste is intent.



	
  1. Instagram got 5 million photo uploads on thanksgiving day

	
  2. 300 million photos are uploaded on facebook every day

	
  3. Etsy gets 100,000 pins daily on Pinterest


Facebook made the web social. Instagram created a photo based social network. Pinterest is creating a network of sharable and ownable visual hyperlinks i.e images that are connected to web pages. Pinterest makes the social web, visual.

	
  1. Pixel Web is about intent

	
  2. Pixel Web breeds new a tribe of highly engaged brand advocates

	
  3. Pixel Web is getting a lot of consumer time spent.


**That makes Pixel Web very monetizable by marketers.**

There are 2 big marketing goals -- brands, agencies, retailers and media companies -- can realize on the Pixel Web:



	
  1. Generate Traffic and Sales - from visual hyperlinks based social networks such as Pinterest.

	
  2. Generate hyper brand engagement - via photo campaigns on instagram, facebook and Tumblr.


3 serial steps to market on the Pixel Web:


### 1. Build a community of advocates and Influencers


Identify your top 10% brand advocates across networks and engage with them. Your site visitors are pinning content from your site organically and expressing brand advocacy on Pinterest. Users on instagram are posting photos with your brand's logo on it. Some fans are much more engaged on your facebook page than others.

Create a rewards program and keep your brand advocates happy. Think about the life-time value of a community -- all the product recommendations and purchases that will stem from those cemented community relationships.

Follow the etiquette and engage in a way that is acceptable in that social network. That will bring your brand on your advocate's radar. They already love you and will start following you cementing that relationship. Thus creating a way your brand can reach them predictably in future.


### 2. Run viral visual campaigns to generate traffic, revenue and engagement.


Once you have an engaged audience base, that becomes your viral seed. Now you are ready to run Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram contests and reach a massive number of users from your engaged audience base.

Promotions on Pinterest are especially great for launching new products, driving traffic, getting massive product impressions, and most importantly generating traffic and sales. [Pinterest promotions are also highly viral ](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/why-pinterest-promotions-are-so-viral/)and result in 150% increase in followers/day on average.


### 3. Run paid visual campaigns to generate traffic and sales.


Pixel Web -- where consumers are expressing taste and intent -- is making it possible to know everything about your audience, fans and customers. It provides 360 intelligence about their product interests, category interests, brand interests and competitor loyalty.

With that 360 intelligence, marketers can run personalized email campaigns to reactivate their customer base, target audience based on interest segments on facebook or run creative photo upload campaigns on instagram. Marketers can promote a Pinterest board on other channels or target pinners on facebook to acquire followers for life time value of advocacy and ROI.

Pixel Web is creating [dCommerce](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/the-rise-of-dcommerce-product-discovery-on-visual-curated-and-self-selected-feeds/) and Discovery Marketing. It is shifting demand creation away from the search box into curated, self-selected feeds. Search is still the king but as Pixel web accelerates, marketers should start thinking about it and thinking about it differently. Marketing on the Pixel Web does not have the instant gratification of a search Ad but it does have the life-time value of sales, ROI, amplification and advocacy from the community.

Pay special attention to Pinterest. In it current state of things, Pinterest is majority of the Pixel Web when it comes to its ROI monetization potential. Read our post on [why pinterest matters](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/notes-from-social-curation-conference-why-pinterest-matters/).
