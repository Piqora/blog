Pinterest is a unique visual interest graph where consumers are self selecting products, e-commerce categories and expressing brand affinity. At Pinfluencer, we think of Pinterest as a giant database of shopping intent. Pinfluencer's analytics product is designed to make it easy for brands and retailers to take advantage of consumer's shopping intent and take direct, repeatable and effective actions to convert those prospective buyers into actual buyers. Here are some specific ways Pinfluencer helps brands and retailers --

**1. Identify and reach out to your prospective buyers**

Pinfluencer's _recent pinner report_ shows your most engaged pinners yesterday, last week etc. Pinfluencer creates an engagement score for these recently engaged pinners which indicate how active these pinners are on your website. The more active they are, the more likely they are to buy. Share this data with your CRM team and use the facebook and twitter handles to reach out to your prospective buyers.

**2. Build relationships with your influential pinners**

Data Scientists at Pinfluencer have created a simple yet sophisticated algorithm to easily measure the influence of your engaged pinners and followers. [Influential Pinners](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/why-influential-pinners-matter/) create disproportionate # of repins for your content. The more influential pinners visit your site or profile and pin, the more clicks your website gets.

**3. Measure your brand engagement on Pinterest**

If you don't measure it, you don't act on it. Pinfluencer's expert team of data scientists have created KPIs around Pin-Rate, Virality, Revenue/Pin etc. to help you stay on top of your pinterest performance. Pinfluencer computes engagement score for every pin, pinner and board to help you decide where to focus your social media and marketing efforts.
