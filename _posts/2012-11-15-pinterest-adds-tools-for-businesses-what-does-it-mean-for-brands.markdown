# So what does this mean for you?




## The Good News


First of all this is really exciting. Pinterest is taking a stand to be more business-friendly and is acknowledging the value of brands towards keeping the quality of content high on Pinterest. It is also nod towards all prosumers - designers, wedding planners and artists who have built their beautiful collections on Pinterest. They can now get verified and establish a formal presence on Pinterest.

Pinterest has endorsed promotions and is recommending brands to run Pinterest contests and sweepstakes in order to boost audience acquisition and drive engagement. They featured Jetsetter's scavenger hunt contest in their case study -- which was powered by Pinfluencer :). Pinfluencer has tracked over 50 Pinterest promotions and is powering one by Sephora right now at[sweeps.pinfluencer.com/sephorawish](http://sweeps.pinfluencer.com/sephorawish). As a marketer you may want to start considering adding Pinterest promotions to your overall mix.

Widgets! - Marketers should cautiously experiment with the pins and boards widget and see if those integrations keep your site visitors longer on site and  engage with those pins.


## The Non News


Analytics was not a part of this launch. Marketers are challenged with [tracking Pin ROI](http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/pinfluencer-launches-pin-roi-tracking-system-for-pinterest-supports-integration-with-google-analytics-omniture-coremetrics/) on their own or manually, figuring out who the influential pinners are, which pins and boards are going viral, and how well their competitors are performing. Tracking ROI is currently not addressed by Pinterest. Thankfully, Pinfluencer can help with our industry leading [Pinterest promotions and analytics platform](http://www.pinfluencer.com/promotions).
