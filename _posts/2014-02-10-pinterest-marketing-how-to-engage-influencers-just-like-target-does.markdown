In Pinterest marketing news, [Target](http://mashable.com/2014/02/10/target-pinterest-party/) announced today that they're launching an exclusive collection of party-hosting products designed by some of Pinterest's top pinners.

Design partnerships, or "diffusion lines" for well-known designers are nothing new for Target, but this is the first time the retailer has worked with influential pinners on Pinterest to design a collection of products.

Partnering with these influencers isn't an experiment for Target. With a combined following 24+ million Pinterest users, this collection makes as much (or more!) sense for the retailer as the Philippe Starck, Zac Posen, and Michael Graves collections. 



<blockquote>"We definitely see today’s top Pinners as expert curators of style and design. We think their unique point-of-view will resonate well with our guests who regularly rely on Pinterest for inspiration and ideas." - [Rick Gomez, SVP of Marketing](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3026239/target-to-launch-collections-created-by-pinterests-top-pinners), Target</blockquote>



So, if the 2nd largest retailer in the country thinks engaging with Pinterest influencers makes sense for their brand, then that's a really good reason why it may make sense for your brand too.


## How To Identify Influencers on Pinterest:


<!-- more -->
Piqora's complete marketing suite for the visual web gives you two ways to identify influencers and brand Advocates on Pinterest.

1. **Most Popular Users by Interest Category Dashboard** - Below is a screenshot showing a sample dashboard of influential users in the DIY & Crafts category on Pinterest. No surprise that Joy Cho (and her 13.6+ million followers) is one of the pinners Target choose to partner with.

_How You Can Replicate Target's Strategy:_ Directly underneath each influencers name are links to their profiles on Pinterest, Twitter, and/or Facebook. Reach out to them on Twitter from your brands account, repin their pins, or comment on their Facebook status to start a conversation about working together.

2. **Your Website's Top Pinners Dashboard** - The dashboard below shows your brand's advocates. These folks may be less well known than the top influencers in a particular category, but they are pinning images and products from your brands website - and those pins are getting repinned.

_How You Can Replicate Target's Strategy:_ The pinners shown on this dashboard are driving the most traffic and awareness for your brand. Reach out to them about partnering on a future campaign, or get insight on what they love about your products.
