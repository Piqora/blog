Since [Google announced the winding down of Wildfire](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-ends-wildfire-2014-3) last week, many brands that had been working with the social media marketing company have started looking for Wildfire alternatives.

Here are 3 ways that innovative brands can use their Wildfire subscription refunds to establish themselves on networks beyond Facebook:


## 1.	Launch a Promotion on Pinterest

The web is becoming visual, and interest-based and Pinterest is at the forefront of that transformation. Visual channels are discovery driven not search driven, so Pinterest promotions like the one above can drive 2,000-10,000 participants, and 30,000 to 50,000 repins, generating a huge amount of brand awareness, exactly where folks are looking to discover brands.

Choose from promotion types like create-a-board, pin-to-win, follow-only, or a combination of them. Piqora has powered over 500 successful promotions on Pinterest, and provides a dedicated customer success manager for each customer promotion.

## 2.	Launch a Photo Contest on Instagram

There is no better way to grow your community on Instagram that a photo contest. Your dedicated customer success manager will provide strategy and execution help the entire way, and Piqora’s analytics dashboards show participants, posts, comments, and likes for your contest.

You can also sort photo contest participants by eligibility with 1-click. No more mammoth spreadsheets.


## 3.	Get Instagram Photos, On Your Site

Part of Piqora’s complete marketing suite for the visual web is Foto Gallery. It enables you to tell visual stories on your website that feature your brand’s products and aesthetic, by displaying photos from any hashtag on Instagram to your site. 

These are just a few of the ways that forward-thinking brands can make use of the little windfall they received courtesy of the Wildfire sunset announcement last week.
