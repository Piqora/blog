Pinterest unveiled their [new analytics platform](http://business.pinterest.com/en/pinterest-analytics) earlier this week as the latest addition to their [Pinterest for business](http://business.pinterest.com/en) toolkit. After being announced in June and beta tested with a select number of brands, the new tools are now available for free to anyone with a [verified business account](https://www.pinterest.com/business/create/).

Pinterest's new analytics dashboard provides brands with a broad overview of their reach on the platform, and will display metrics such as the number of views and impressions that their content generated, and will track those numbers over time. In addition to trend data, Pinterest now provides insights into specific Pin performance such as likes, clicks, impressions, and repins, as well as what type of of Pin a particular piece of content is, which allows you to track performance of [Rich Pins and Promoted Pins](http://blog.piqora.com/rich-pins-from-pinterest-useful-and-actionable/). Finally, the new tools display demographic and common interest data.

All of this is great news for brands marketing on Pinterest.  With these tools, brands will be able to paint a much more accurate picture of what is and isn't working for them on Pinterest than they were with the old analytics, and they can use this information to inform and make strategic decisions on their content.


## How Piqora Can Help Your Brand Level Up on Pinterest


While the new analytics tools are good for high level analysis of your brand's overall Pinterest strategy, Piqora can help you take the critical next steps towards enhancing your success on Pinterest and optimizing your content and revenue strategies. For example, while Pinterest's audience demographics will report general location, gender and language, our platform takes that a step further with granular audience data, which allows you to foster relationships with brand advocates and identify and engage with influencers.

For brands that rely on Pinterest as a commerce platform, Piqora provides critical Pinterest ROI data that wouldn't otherwise be available, such as revenue per pin and revenue per purchase. This means you can not only see what kinds of content are successful from an engagement standpoint, but how also how much revenue each piece of content generates from the platform.

Piqora doesn't just support reporting, it facilitates research. Analyzing your own content is important, but companies don't exist in bubbles. Pinterest is a social ecosystem, and it pays huge dividends to be able to accurately and effectively analyze what the other brands in your "food chain" are doing on the platform. With Piqora, you can identify industry-wide trends and compare your performance to that of your competition.

Finally, Piqora simplifies the process and greatly enhances your brand's ability to run a successful Pinterest promotion. In addition to supporting multiple types of promotions that conform to Pinterest's guidelines and providing advanced promotion reporting, every brand that runs a Pinterest promotion with Piqora is assigned a dedicated Customer Success Manager to help you establish and implement the best practices to maximize your success.

All of these elements are critical, especially for larger brands on the network. The advantage of a platform such as Piqora lies in the specificity and richness of the data provided, which enables brands to go beyond interpreting broad trends and allows specific, actionable strategic and tactical decisions to be made, both from a content and commerce perspective.
