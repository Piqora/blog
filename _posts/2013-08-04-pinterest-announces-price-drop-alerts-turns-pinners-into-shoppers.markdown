Pinterest recently [announced](http://blog.pinterest.com/post/57057851300/pin-a-little-save-a-little) that it will start emailing price drop alerts to its users. For users this is a great way of getting notified when the prices of their favorite products fall. Unlike search where users have immediate purchase intent, shopping intent of pinners has future value to it. With this feature, Pinterest pushes pinners lower down in the purchase funnel.

Pinterest is a network that sits between social media and social commerce. We have noted before that [Pinterest is the new e-commerce central](http://blog.piqora.com/rich-pins-from-pinterest-useful-and-actionable/) and these very useful features for pinners are bringing Pinterest ever closer to true e-commerce discovery and transactions.

As a brand or a retailer this is fantastic news as your rich pins now have higher chances of showing up in your potential shopper's inbox. Not only your products can be discovered on the visual feed of Pinterest's home page or search page, but they can be retargeted to your pinners turning them into clickers and shoppers.

Think of price drop alerts as email retargeting done for your products by Pinterest.

To take advantage of this opportunity, you need to make sure your website supports rich pins. Rich pins through a simple code snippet integration on your product pages, can pull the product price and availability in real-time and overlay that data automatically on a pin. Rich pins are the way to communicate price information to both Pinterest and Pinners.
