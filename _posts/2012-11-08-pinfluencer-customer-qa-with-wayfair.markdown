At Pinfluencer, we like to work closely with our customers and build products that solve their business problems. A big part of that is listening and sharing that learning with the community. Pinfluencer recently spoke with Trisha Mack, Head of Social from [WayFair.com](http://wayfair.com). [![](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trisha.png)](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/trisha.png)




### **What business needs does Pinterest serve for Wayfair?**




<blockquote>Our goal at Wayfair.com is to offer our customers the largest selection of home goods and furnishings anywhere online. We have a selection of more than 5 million items and we’re adding new products every day.

Pinterest is an amazing channel for product discovery.  The natural behavior of Pinterest involves clicking out of network to view more details about a pin. This makes Pinterest a valuable referral channel for us. We need site visitors like a brick and mortar retailer needs people to walk through the door and right now Pinterest is delivering for us. What’s even more amazing is that these customers are proving to be good quality with a higher average order value and deeper site engagement than our average visitor.<!-- more --></blockquote>




### ** ****How does Pinterest fit into your greater social and marketing strategies?**




<blockquote>Pinterest is a community full of our target customers and they’re actively engaging with home décor content. It’s a perfect fit for our product offering and content. Right now, we’re focused on building the Wayfair.com brand and a big part of that is allowing our target consumer to discover our extensive selection of home furnishings in many different ways. We want to continue to bring our customers great content to share and maximize onsite product sharing.</blockquote>




###  **What attracted you to Pinfluencer?**




<blockquote>Kris reached out to us when Pinfluencer first launched. We were already investing a lot of time in Pinterest but we were unable to really understand how people were engaging with Wayfair.com products. We couldn’t effectively track the number of total pins generated from our site daily because so many people use the browser add-on. Pinfluencer presented a solution to the above and so much more. We’re data and numbers people at our core here so we love having access to all these stats!</blockquote>




### ** ****How has Pinfluencer delivered value to your business?**




<blockquote>Pinfluencer has enabled us to gain insight into the specific activities of our followers- which products and content they are pinning and when. We’re also able to identify influencers amongst our followers and more broadly in the home space- this is a big initiative for us as we look to grow our brand recognition against our target market. One area we’re really excited about diving into is seeing how Pinterest activity around specific products and categories can predict or impact sales. We have a couple fun ideas to try in the coming months.</blockquote>




### **Which features and metrics do you use most?**




<blockquote>We’re constantly looking at our tops pins from our site, our most influential pinners and our competitor stats. Knowing this information has really helped us set new goals and keep innovating.</blockquote>




### ** ****If you could change one thing about Pinterest what would it be?**




<blockquote>We have an amazing team of engineers and creative minds here at Wayfair and we’re focused on building tools and features on our site that are valuable to our customer and ultimately help change how people shop for home furnishings and décor.  We’d be able to do some really fun things if we can integrate our site experience more closely with Pinterest.</blockquote>
