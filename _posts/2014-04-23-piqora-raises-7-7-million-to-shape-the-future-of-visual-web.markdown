From a kitchen table office in 2012 and a couple of analytics tabs to 100s of happy customers, billions of images, and a complete visual marketing suite for Pinterest, Instagram & Tumblr, Piqora has come a long way. Our conviction in the emotional power of Visual Web and [the opportunity that represents for brands](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2014/04/23/whats-an-instagram-or-pinterest-picture-really-worth/) just won some more allies. Investors in Tesla and Box have decided to back Piqora in helping us bring brands and consumers together visually, emotionally and authentically. [DFJ Ventures](http://dfjvc.tumblr.com/post/83614370598/piqora) along with Altos, Freestyle, Baseline, Lazerow and Firebolt Ventures has led our [$7.7 million series A round](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/23/marketing-suite-for-visual-web-piqora-raises-7-7-million-series-a/). We chose to partner with DFJ given our shared conviction in image driven marketing and a strong chemistry with firm's partners. To date we have raised more than $11 million in venture capital.

The past 12 months have been very exciting. We expanded our Pinterest Marketing Suite to include Instagram and Tumblr, doubled our team to 25, added 100s of customers, made some mistakes and learned along the way. We are a better and larger company as a result. And more committed than ever to serve our customers, educate the market, and expand our product to help brands emotionally connect with today's visual consumers.

Our customers are our biggest asset. Nothing matters more than them. Our customer success team is an internal champion of our customers, an advocate of their needs, a pervasive voice in every discussion. And the new capital will help us make the lives of customers even easier. Product innovation, expansion to more visual networks, educational content and dedicated customer engagement is our road ahead.

We take pride in the friendly and passionate culture we have created here. Some of it is active engineering but most of it reflects the people we have hired. Piqorans come from top tier companies - Google, Yahoo, Wildfire to name a few. We are a passionate bunch, inspired to achieve and generate results. As we say here "Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History - 2 out of 3 is not an option". And finally we want to thank the social networks and our data partners without whom we wouldn't have come this far.

Thank you for your support. We look forward to partnering and working with you.
