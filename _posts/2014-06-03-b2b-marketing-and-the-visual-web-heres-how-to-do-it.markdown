B2B marketers are used to incorporating social media into our campaigns. Well, specifically we’re used to incorporating Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn into campaigns. Only a few B2B marketers have started talking about Pinterest, Instagram or Tumblr yet. The reality is that the visual web is the next frontier for B2B marketers, and below is an example of how to do it right.


## Remember When Twitter Didn’t Matter for B2B?


Sure, companies like HP, Cisco, Intel, and EMC sell six-figure IT solutions, and the audience for those solutions don’t immediately think about Pinterest or Instagram as the go-to network for researching enterprise solutions. Running an Instagram promotion around, “How To Program a Cloud Service In Your Backyard,” is destined to flop. That’s fair to say. Of course, it’s also fair to mention that Twitter was dismissed by B2B back in 2007 too. Now it’s a crucial [lead source for B2B marketers](http://socialmediatoday.com/scott-gulbransen/2263016/twitter-becoming-powerful-b2b-marketing-tool). 

So, today almost _every_ big B2B company is on Twitter because just having a voice on that platform is really important. If you’re not present, the reaction from other B2B marketers is like, “Wait, you don’t have a Twitter account?” 

Enterprise businesses are using Twitter for support, customers engagement, and product announcements. At the end of the day no matter what size business you are, or what you’re selling, the buyer is still always a person. And people do a lot of research on social networks, and your social profiles (or lack thereof) will affect their buying decisions, one way or another.


## What The Visual Web Can Do for B2B


Where do Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr fit in? Well, pinning photos of a million dollar server might not drive traffic.  Even taking a photo of cloud storage is a challenge.  Here’s what B2B marketers can do: **showcase who you are as a company**.

Show what your company does for the community and the causes your employees support. Anything from photos of the annual company picnic to individual Pinterest boards for the IT teams’ favorite hobbies. Cisco does a great job on Instagram of appealing to their audience’s sci-fi interests, with posts like “may the fourth be with you” for Star Wars Day.

Another great example is from [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/), a large B2B company (and Piqora customer), who launched an Instagram promotion around their Pixlr image editing app using the hashtag #imadeit. The results exceeded expectations with 4,000 user generated photos published, generating over 59,000 likes.

## 1000 Words On Why To Work Here, In An Instant


For the same reason we all research products online, people research companies online when considering their next career move. So, if your B2B company is not on Pinterest, Instagram, or Tumblr (and your competition is) think about the potential human capital you could be missing out on.  

Here at Piqora we help companies manage content and measure results on the visual web. For B2B marketers one of those key results is how your company is perceived in the eyes of former, current and future colleagues.
