Pinterest announced in its [blog](http://blog.pinterest.com/post/56525800591/making-pinterest-a-bit-more-personal) a new personalization feature that will recommend pins based on the sites the user has been pinning from. Users still have to self-select into these recommendations from the edit-home-feed page. For e.g. if you have been pinning a lot from shoes sites, you'll be suggested more shoes or if you have been pinning a lot from party sites you'll see more party stuff, or other pins from those sites in your recommendations.

Online personalization makes the experience of internet users that much more relevant, personal and actionable. By seeing more relevant pins directly in their feed, users are much more likely to act on those pins -- repin them on to boards, click through to visit the product page and and even buy that product.

This is great news for online retailers, brands and websites that have pinnable content. If your website has been getting traffic from Pinterest, you can expect to get even more traffic from Pinterest via these recommendations. That's a new kind of viral loop. More of your brand pins are being pushed to the users creating a higher reach and exposure of your brand's content.

Brands can take advantage of this viral loop by optimizing their websites for pinning. Specifically:



	
  1. Your pins show up in recommendations only if you have a pin-it button installed on your site. So make sure you do.

	
  2. The personalization feature is not just recommending pins but also pin-boards. It's never been more important to create your profile and keep your pinterest boards populated with fresh and appealing images.

	
  3. With users having much more granular and ongoing control -- it becomes even more important to monitor the # of followers and un-follows to your boards and keep that number growing. Piqora's top boards reports helps with that.

	
  4. Monitor your competition. It now becomes possible that your competitor's pins and pin-boards get recommended alongside yours as pinterest is using site category to determine interest. For e.g. Zappos.com might be killing it on Pinterest but a top board from shoes.com pinterest profile board can be potentially recommended next to Zappos -- create more choice for the user but more competition for your brand.
