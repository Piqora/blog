Pinterest is gaining the mindshare of marketers because Pinners, unlike Facebookers, engage in an unfettered, collection-style sharing unburdened from judgement of their friends, or the risk of spamming them. There have been quite a few [studies](http://socialcommercetoday.com/pinterest-purchase-funnel-2-1x-as-facebook-infographic/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+socialcommercetoday+%28Social+Commerce+Today%29) done to map the path from pin to purchase. Because of this growing phenomenon, we decided to turn inwards into our data and quantify the value of a pinner.

First some definitions: A Pinner is someone who visits your website and pins directly from your website. These site visitors pin either via the bookmarklet or the pin-it button. Those Pins then multiply within Pinterest via repins. The more influential your site visitors are, the more copies of your products start to circulate. Those pins and repins show up in the feeds of pinterest users and drive clicks and purchases. Pinning from your site visitors is key to getting those repins and eyeballs that eventually drive traffic and sales.

**Mapping the economic value of a Pinner**

Pinfluencer tracked about 500 mid-size and large retailers and brands in July 2012 and from a sample of [_online_ _retailers_](http://www.internetretailer.com/2012/07/31/pinfluencer-debuts-analytics-engine-pinterest) who have connected their Google Analytics account with their Pinfluencer account, we saw:



	
  * **An average Pinner drives between 40 cents to $4 in _revenue_ a month**

	
  * **On average 1000 Pinners drive between 8 to 65 _purchases_ a month**

	
  * **An average Pinner drives between 4 and 30 _pageviews_ a month**


Disclaimer: the data above is not based on a statistically valid sample. This is simply the range Pinfluencer saw across its retailer customers. We are confident in its validity for high level benchmarking.

Not all Pinners are created equal, with a handful of users driving a disproportionate share of repins on Pinterest and therefore to your website. Because of this, influential Pinners (those with a high number of followers and repin/pin ratio for your brand) are incredibly valuable to any marketer with a product to sell or a brand or lifestyle to communicate. By representing your content in custom curated board galleries, influential Pinners have become self-appointed merchandisers for your product and brand.

**Recognize and Reward Influential Pinners**

To make the most of this dynamic, there are two things any Pinterest marketer needs to know: which Pinners are most influential and which products, images, and categories resonate the most.  This information allows you as a marketer to see how influential Pinners are representing your brand, which images resonate with which users, and what other images are associated with increased user interest. The next natural step is to reward your influential Pinners. After all, they are your most important digital brand advocates. Gift certificates, Tweets or posts, featured mentions on your blog, or the gift of their most recent pin would encourage your Pinfluencers to keep pinning and sharing your brand with their strong and growing networks.
