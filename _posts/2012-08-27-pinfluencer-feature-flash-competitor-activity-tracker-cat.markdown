Adding to our very extensive and granular competitor analytics for Pinterest, we just launched Competitor Activity Tracker (CAT) giving insights into what a_ brand or a competitor actually did_ on pinterest yesterday, past week etc. Competitor Activity Tracker (CAT) helps brands compare and benchmark their actions and activity with their competition.

If you ever wanted to know which of your competitors is pinning, following, commenting, re-pinning more than your brand -- CAT is your answer. CAT report allows brands to easily see which other brands are more or less active on pinterest. Who is employing re-pinning as their pinterest presence strategy? Which brands have suddenly started creating many boards? Which competitors are having actual conversations with their users on Pinterest?<!-- more -->

All the above questions answered: in one single report. CAT is reflection of a brand's pinterest strategy and is a great learning and benchmarking tool.


Agencies can use the above report to demonstrate how their pinterest efforts compare in volume with their client's competitors. Social media managers can use this report to make a case for a bigger and stronger pinterest management budget.
