Did anyone get a ton of holiday shopping done over the Thanksgiving weekend? I definitely did!

This year, e-commerce revenue from Pinterest grew an average of 25% on Black Friday and 74% on Cyber Monday from 2013 to 2014. During the entire Thanksgiving shopping weekend, Pinterest-sourced revenue increased 71% from 2013. Our data revealed that Revenue-per-Pin also increased 55% on Cyber Monday and 4% on Black Friday.

For retailers, Thanksgiving always been a monumental weekend as many holiday shoppers are eager for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. This year, the value of e-commerce orders from Pinterest drove a 18% increase in Pinterest referral traffic on Thanksgiving weekend (with a 16% increase on Black Friday and 23% increase on Cyber Monday compared to 2013).

When I was in high school, I would look at newspaper ads the night before Black Friday and mapping out my shopping plan of attack. Fast forward to today; shoppers no longer need to stand in line at 4am to wait for brick-and-mortar store locations to open so they can get the best deal or the right gift on their shopping list. Instead, they are increasingly spending more time discovering products online and leveraging Pinterest as the inspiration and initial source during their shopping journey.

So what does all of this mean exactly? First, people aren't just shopping on Black Friday anymore but instead, using all of the days of that long Thanksgiving weekend to shop and prepare for the holidays, especially Cyber Monday. Second, Pinterest is often where shoppers are first introduced to a brand or product and where they are discovering, curating and in turn, purchasing products.

Check out our new infographic sharing more Pinterest and holiday shopping data and insights.

Happy holidays!
