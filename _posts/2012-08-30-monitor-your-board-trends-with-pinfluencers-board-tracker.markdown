We just gave our boards tab a fresh new look, added time slices and added 3 more board reports. We also added a new section in the metrics tab called "Total Board Metrics". This new design and metrics for boards tabs helps agencies and brands easily monitor board activity and engagement trends and answer following questions very simply -

1. Which was my most liked/repinned/commented/followed board yesterday, in past 7 days etc?<!-- more -->

2. How many total likes/repins/comments did my profile boards get yesterday, past 7 days etc?

3. How many likes/repins/comments did a "particular" board get in a given time period?

4. Which are the top pins for a "particular" board?

5. Which board has recently surged/lost in popularity?

What hasn't changed is the beautiful, grid lay out of the boards. Give the new boards tab and board metrics a whirl and drop us a note at hello@pinfluencer.com.
