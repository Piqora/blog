Pinterest is just the first of the visual networks to stimulate brand and content discovery in such a significant way and so quickly. Now Tumblr, Instagram, and Vine-- are the future of entertainment, curation, creation and connections. Online consumers are looking beyond relationship oriented networks such as Facebook and looking to find inspiration, discover content and make connections around their interests on new visual networks. The public and visual nature of these networks enables us to mine this interest graph and turn it into intent for marketers.

Unlike Facebook which is a personal social graph and a closed network, Visual networks are public and interest-based with a very high degree of virality and organic engagement around brand's content. Your brand is being discussed on instagram and tumblr regardless of an official presence. Piqora's technology helps you uncover trends, advocates, and influencers on these networks.

Visual Networks are big and growing. Pinterest is the 3rd largest e-commerce centric social network with over 10+ Billion pins , drives strong purchase intent traffic with a Revenue/Visitor of $1.47 and average order value of $169. Instagram on the other hand is a mobile centric photo and hashtag based social network that has 130+ million active users, 16+ billion photos uploaded and 1+ billion likes as of June 2013. Tumblr, a heavy image based micro blogging network is the largest interest-based network with 225+ million global uniques, 118+ million blogs, 59+ Billion posts and 80+ million posts daily (as of June 2013).
