Everyone knows that promotions and the holidays go hand-in-hand, regardless of the marketing channel. Whether it's social media or traditional advertising, with consumer spending at its peak brands need to be promoting their products as much as possible. Consumer spending is at it’s highest: According to ComScore, 30% of retail e-commerce consumer spending took place in Q4 2012, with a majority concentrated in the second half of Q4. Consumer use of social media is also at its peak, especially on mobile devices.

Avid Instagrammer @Julesfan went Christmas shopping and took nearly a dozen photos at her favorite boutiques and, in typical Instagram fashion, she added a ton or hashtags to each photo: #gucci, #gold, #stores, #shopping, #new, #newstore, #departmentstores, #tistheseason, #malls, #bloomys, #bloomingdals, #glendale, #glendalegalleria, #christmasshopping, #fun, #money, and #christmasshopping. Wow! 


## Pinterest and Instagram Are the Place for Your Brand to Be


The best social media contests are promoted across all available marketing channels, but are still typically based primarily on one social network. Pinterest and Instagram are ideal platforms for holiday promotions and have a many advantages over incumbents like Facebook. Here are our top 6 reasons why Instagram and Pinterest are great options for holiday promotions:



	
  1. Consumers spend more than 27% of total time online during Q4 on social networking apps according to Experian. They are extremely active on social networks and are creating lots of content that relates to products and brands. They are creating holiday wish lists on Pinterest, using Instagram to take pictures at events, and Instagramming their presents on Christmas day.

	
  2. Because consumers are so active on Pinterest and Instagram already during the holidays, it’s easy for them to participate in contests, effectively lowering the barrier to entry.

	
  3. Like Instagrammer @Julesfan, consumers are using social networks on their mobile devices while shopping – a lot. According to a recent study by Useablenet, 30% of US shoppers and 40% of UK shoppers use their smartphones when shopping in brick-and-mortar stores, with 64% engaging on social networks in the US, and 45% in the UK.

	
  4. Regardless of the time of year, promotions are by far the fastest way to increase followers, engagement, community and loyalty – but they are at their most efficient around the holidays. Given that Instagram and Pinterest are extremely viral (more viral than Facebook) holiday promotions are a very efficient way to build communities.

	
  5. Pinterest promotions consistently increase website referral traffic and sales, and we’ve also seen them increase AOV. With the holiday pinning fervor on Pinterest you can get even more traffic than usual – don't miss out!

  6. Brand storytelling is intrinsic to the holiday season – or at least it should be - and Instagram is an ideal platform for telling a story about your brand. In the age of price-driven e-commerce, many retailers are so focused on direct response advertising that they inadvertently neglect good creative. You can use Instagram to make a connection with consumers that leads them to feel good about your brand and the experience of purchasing your product. This will help to create awareness early on in the customer decision-making process and may enable you to rely less on direct-response advertising.
