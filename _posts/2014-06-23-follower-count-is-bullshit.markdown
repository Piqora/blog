Like most marketers (myself included), I'd guess that you've invested significant time and money in social media over the last few years, in search of "social media success." But what _is_ social media success? Lots of retweets? A legion of followers? A viral dance video? It was with this challenge in mind that I quickly [favorited a tweet](https://twitter.com/djwaldow/status/473611314443849728) from one of my favorite marketing follows, [DJ Waldow](https://twitter.com/djwaldow), that pointed to a presentation created by a social media expert named [Mackenzie (Mack) Fogelson](https://twitter.com/mackfogelson), Founder and CEO of Mack Web. The presentation, startlingly titled, "[Why Follower Count is Bullshit,](http://go.piqora.com/follower-count-webinar.html?LS=Blog)" pulled me right in. In it, Mack details her journey on social media and what she's learned about measuring the impact of the resource investment on the different platforms.





## I was inspired to learn more:




![](http://go.piqora.com/rs/pinfluencer/images/pq_mackfogelson.png)I enjoyed it so much that I reached out to Mack directly. It turns out this presentation had taken on a life of its own, having been viewed nearly 20,000 times as of this posting. It's clear that this is something many marketers are dealing with, and I was thrilled when she agreed to [share the presentation, along with her stories and experiences behind it, with our audience (you!) in a webinar format.](http://go.piqora.com/follower-count-webinar.html?LS=Blog)











## How to take part:




[So join us](http://go.piqora.com/follower-count-webinar.html?LS=Blog)! We've put an hour on the calendar on July 24th at 11am PT/2pm ET for Mack to walk us through her story and to take questions.  If proving the value of social to your team is something you're interested in, you won't want to miss it!
