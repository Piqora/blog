Our head of customer success, Alex Littlewood, is now running a bi-monthly educational webinar on [Pinterest promotions best practices](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/pinterest-contests-and-sweepstakes-webinar-by-pinfluencer/  ) and [Pinterest ROI Analytics](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/pinterest-analytics-and-true-social-roi-webinar-by-pinfluencer/) to help marketers make the most out of Pinterest. While the [previous webinar on promotions](http://blog.pinfluencer.com/pinterest-contests-and-sweepstakes-webinar-by-pinfluencer/  ) focussed on the overall strategy of why and how you should run a promotion, our latest one focussed more on the _tactics_ and the nuts and bolts of running a successful contest or a sweepstake. We talk about some simple things that often get overlooked and end up hurting your promotion. The webinar was atttended by more than 130 marketers and there is some great Q&A at the end. Check it out here and bookmark this blog :). Email us at hello@pinfluencer.com to get notified for these webinars.
